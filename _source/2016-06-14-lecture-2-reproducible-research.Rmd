# Overview

Within this lecture, we will explore the benefits of adhering to reproducible techniques. Namely, we will want to harmously unite R code with textual analysis in two ways: 1. Using in-line code and 2. externalizing code. Next, the key to reproducibility is having a record of what was done when and by who via a version control system ala git.
