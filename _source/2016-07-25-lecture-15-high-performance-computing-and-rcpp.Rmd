# Overview

*R* enables an **interactive** exploration environment for data
but sacrifices *speed* to accomplish this goal. In a world where you can sit in 
a Maine dinner, order clam chowder, have a random thought about statistics that
can be solved by pulling out a smartphone to instanteously search for a result,
any delay will discourage people from using the method. Part of the 
High Performance Computing push is to encourage the creation of highly
performant code. To do so within *R*, we turn to using [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org).

# Guides to Setting up a Compiler

By Operating System:

- [Rtools for Windows](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/announcements/2016/07/25/install-rtools-for-rcpp/)
- [MacOS](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-os-x/)
- Linux: make sure to have `r-base-dev` installed.
