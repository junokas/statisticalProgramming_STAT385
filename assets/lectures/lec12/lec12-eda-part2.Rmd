# Moving along... 

- We're going to cover **Graphing in *R*** next!

# Graphing in *R*

- Before now, we never really focused on plotting. 
- Instead, we aimed to understand the computing logic behind calculations in *R*. 
- Now, to support visual *EDA*, we really need to start focusing on such features. 

# *R* and the Three Graphing Systems

- Dilemma: There are ***3*** graphing systems to chose from in *R*.
- Similar to the **[Goldilocks and the Three Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_and_the_Three_Bears)** problem.

![](img/3bears.jpg)

- Selecting the graphical system is important...

# Different Plotting Systems in *R* - Overview

- R's `Base` plotting system.
    - `plot()`, `hist()`, `barplot()`
-  `lattice` formulaic graphing in *R*.
    -  `xyplot()`, `dotplot()`, `histogram()`, `*plot()` 
- `ggplot2` rapid layered graphing approach
    - graphs start with `ggplot()` and add layers via `+` typically denoted by `geom_point()` , `geom_*()`

# *R*'s Base Plotting System - Example

- View it as an artists blank canvas
```{r, fig.height=5}
plot(NULL, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1), 
     ylab="Y Axis label", xlab="X Axis label")
```

# *R*'s Base Plotting System - Example

- Each subsequent function calls adds lines, points, axis, et cetera.

```{r echo = -c(1:3), fig.height=4}
plot(NULL, xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1), 
     ylab="Y Axis label", xlab="X Axis label")

set.seed(114)
x = runif(10); y = runif(10)
abline(h = .5)                # Horizontal Line
abline(v = .25, col="purple") # Vertical Line w/ color
points(x, y, pch = 1:10)      # Points w/ shapes
axis(1, .5, LETTERS[1], col.axis = "blue")
```

# *R*'s Base Plotting System - Verdict

- **Con:** No ability to change plot settings (e.g. `?par` settings) or draw content added once started.
- **Pros:** Easier custom graphs and higher quality graphs (e.g. [AVLR](http://smac-group.com/assets/pdfs/AVLR.pdf#page=4) using the
[`tikzDevice` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tikzDevice/vignettes/tikzDevice.pdf) )

- **Verdict: Academics only**


```{r too_hot_goldilocks, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/too_hot_goldilocks.jpg")
```

# `lattice` - A formulaic approach to graphs.

- The [`lattice` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html) written by [Deepayan Sarkar](http://www.isid.ac.in/~deepayan/) provides the ability to make graphs in *one* call vs. Base R's multiple
calls.  

- The call form is normally:

```{r eval = FALSE}
type_of_plot(formula, data=list())
```

- Uses the `formula` object associated with `lm` to specify: *response* (`y~`), *explanatory* (`~x`), *conditional relationships* (`y~x|A`).

- Great for viewing conditional relationships and multivariate data. 

# `lattice` - Example

```{r}
xyplot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)
```

# `lattice` - Example with Condition

```{r}
xyplot(mpg ~ disp|cyl, data = mtcars) # Note the |
```

# `lattice` - Verdict

- **Cons:** Everything in 1 function call is *messy* and awkward.
- **Pros:** Handle all margin settings of multiple graphs and conditioning.

- **Verdict: Casual *R* users.**


```{r too_cold_goldilocks, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/too_cold_goldilocks.jpg")
```

# `ggplot2` - Grammar of Graphics 

- `ggplot2` is the implementation of the pivotal 1999 Book [Grammar of Graphics](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447) by [Leland Wilkinson](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/).
    - Each Graph shares a common structure.
    - The difference between graphs is different component layers and rules.

# `ggplot2` - Grammar of Graphics 
 
- Historical Information
    - [`ggplot1`](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot1) written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) as part of [his PhD thesis](http://had.co.nz/thesis/).
    - [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2) released for ease of use alongside [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)
    - [UseR 2016 Keynote: `ggplot1` is better than `ggplot2` API wise due to the piping operator](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Towards-a-grammar-of-interactive-graphics)
         - Time: 36:38 to 38:32

# `ggplot2` - Scatterplot

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(mtcars) +               # Supply data.frame
  geom_point(aes(disp, mpg))   # Add points to plot
```

# `ggplot2` - Scatterplot Conditioned

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(mtcars) +               # Supply data.frame
  geom_point(aes(disp, mpg)) + # Add points to plot

# `ggplot2` - Verdict

- **Cons:** Data must be in a `data.frame`, global scoping of variables, data copies, and simple things might be *complex*.
- **Pros:** Rapidly iterate visualizations,  grammatical structure, and extendable graphing system.

- **Verdict: Data Scientists, Researchers, and Causal *R* users.**

# I lied... 

- As is the case with technology, there always a new graphing system around the
corner. 
- Coming Soon a 4th Graphical System for *R* using the parts of `ggplot2`....


# `ggvis` - Coming Soon (TM)

- Introducing [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/), the successor to `ggplot2`...

![](img/ggvis_plot.png)


# `ggvis` - Coming Soon (TM)

- [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) will usher in a new way of interactive 
graphics (think `identify()`). Keep an eye on this project.
- Alas, as the API is currently in flux, we will not dedicate any time to
it. However, note that `ggvis` replaces `ggplot2`'s concatenation with the
`%>%` operator.

# `ggvis` - Example

```{r eval = F}
# install.packages("ggvis")
library("ggvis")
mtcars %>% ggvis(~wt, ~mpg) %>% layer_points()
```


```{r ggvis_scatter_plot, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggvis_mtcars_plot.png")
```

**Note:** This code can only be run in *HTML* rich environments. No LaTeX 
environments need apply.

# Data Wrangling `birth` from `msos` package.

For the next section, I'll aim to use the `birth` data from `msos`. Note,
the data is in **wide** form in a `matrix`. The below script sets up the 
data for graphing by converting it to **long** form and class `data.frame`.

```{r message = F, warning = F}
# Extract hospital birth dates
data(births, package="msos")

library("tidyr")
df_births = as.data.frame(births)
df_births$time = seq_len(nrow(df_births))
long_births = gather(df_births, hospital, value, -time)
```

# Looking into `long_births`

Let's peek at what the data in `long_births` looks like.

```{r}
head(long_births)
```

**Note:** `long_births` is of class `data.frame`!!

# Your first `ggplot`! 

```{r long_births, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(long_births) +       # Initialize ggplot w/ data
  geom_point(               # Add a point layer
    aes(x = time, y = value)# Add an aesthetic mapping
             )
```

# Your second `ggplot`! 

```{r long_births_color, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(long_births) +    # Initialize ggplot w/ data
  geom_point(            # Add a point layer
    aes(x = time,        # Add an aesthetic mapping
        y = value,       
        color = hospital)# Added color
             )
```


# Key Terms and Ideas with `ggplot2`

- **ggplot**: Initialization function of the graph
- **geom_**: Geometric (shape) objects
- **aes**: Provides the aesthetic options the `geom` should take.
    - Examples: color, fill, transparency (alpha), linetype, and point shape.
- **scales**: Specifies the type of `axis` to use (very problematic)
    - Examples: Continuous, Discrete, $\log{}$, $\sqrt{}$, and so on.
- **facet**: Panel layout
    - Examples: Grid ($x \times y$) or Wrapped
    
# Reusing `ggplot2` base objects

Each `ggplot2` object can be saved individually and added to in the future

```{r fig.height=4}
g = ggplot(long_births) +   
  geom_point(aes(x = time, y = value))

g
```

# Adding Label Information to `ggplot2`

```{r fig.height=4}
(g = g + xlab("Time (hours)") + ylab("Births") + 
  ggtitle("Births vs. Time (hours)"))
```

# Changing `aes` for `geom_point`

```{r fig.height=4}
(g = g + geom_point(aes(x = time, y = value, color = hospital)))

```

# Adding a `facet_wrap` to distinguish variables

```{r fig.height=4}
(g = g + facet_wrap(~hospital))
```

# Graphing with `ggplot2`

- `ggplot2` makes available various geometric objects via `geom_`.
- These objects determine how the data is rendered on the plot.
- Some of the `geoms_*()` typically used:

| `geoms_*()`              |	Description
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `geom_point()`	         | Adds data points to plot                    |
| `geom_line()`	           | Adds connected lines to the plot            |
| `geom_histogram()`	     | Makes a histogram                           |
| `geom_bar()`       	     | Creates a bar chart                         |
| `geom_text()`	           | Adds text annotations                       |
| `geom_violin()`	         | Makes a violin plot                         |

- Many more `geoms_*()` exists and can be found at [docs.ggplot2.org](http://docs.ggplot2.org/) 
with graphing examples!

# Making a histogram

Histograms typically provide count or frequency values on the `y`-axis

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(long_births) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(value), binwidth = 1)
```

# Making a histogram with a density plot

Density plots alongside a histogram require `density` (bounded between 0 and 1)
to be on the `y`-axis. If `count` is on the `y`-axis, then results are not valid.

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(long_births) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = value, y = ..density..),
                 binwidth = 1, color = "orange") + 
  geom_density(aes(value), color = "blue")
```

# Storing `aes` in construction

Specify `aes()` does not necessarily have to be done in the `geom_*()` call. 
Some users prefer to specify the relationship in the `ggplot()` creation.

```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = value)) +  
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), # Notice no `x=`
                 binwidth = 1, color = "orange") + 
  geom_density(color = "blue")         # Notice no `x=`
```

# Boxplot

Boxplot are a helpful way to visualize Q1, Q2, Q3, and outlier information.
They are may be referred to as a *box and whiskers* plot. 

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Boxplot with Points

What is nice, is instead of only seeing outliers, you can also see where all the
points lie just by adding `geom_point()`

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point()
```

# Boxplot with Points Redux

However, adding points without *jittering* them will lead to non-informative
clumping. To avoid this, use a jitter: `geom_jitter()`

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.4)
```


# Flipping My Box

The coordinate system can also change from being y-based to x-based via
`coord_flip()`.

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.4) + 
  coord_flip()
```

# Flipping My Box

The coordinate system can also change from being y-based to x-based via
`coord_flip()`.

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.4) + 
  coord_flip()
```


# Theming - Black & White

`ggplot2` can easily switch to different color themes.
By default, the `theme_gray()` is used. Some prefer
the `theme_bw()`.

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()  + theme_bw()
```

# Theming - Original

```{r fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_births, aes(x = hospital, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()  
```

# The main question:

> Are you team `theme_gray()` or `theme_bw()`?

[Twitter Question](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/676945091525742592)


# Exercises

1. Load `sportsranks` from `msos` and transform it to long form. Make sure to
add an indicator. Try to create boxplots of the different ratings. 
2. Open `states` in the `msos` data set. Explore the different levels of
school enrollment and crime. Try out other dimensions as well!
3. Last but not least, try to explore the `SAheart` data in `msos`.

# Practical Comparison

For the next example, we are going to craft a Q-Q Plot in `Base R` and `ggplot2`.
The Q-Q plot is normally used to check to see if the residuals of a model
follow a normal distribution.

```{r make_data}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(111)

# Generate data
x = runif(100,0,1)
```

# Traditional `q-q` plot in R

Included in *Base R*, without any modification is `qqnorm()`, which provides
the Q-Q Plot. Though, it is missing the traditional line connecting the first
and third quartiles. 

```{r fig.height=4}
qqnorm(x)                  # normal q-q plot
qqline(x,lty=2,col="blue") # line through the Q1 and Q3 quartiles
```

# Crafting the `q-q` plot

```{r q_qplot}
qqn = function(w) {
  n = length(w)
  nv = qnorm((1:n)/(n+1)) # Quantiles of Normal Dist.
  plot(nv, sort(w),       # X,Y
       xlab = "Theoretical Quantiles",
       ylab = "Sample Quantiles")
  title("Normal Q-Q Plot")
  m = (quantile(w,0.75)-quantile(w,0.25))/
      (qnorm(0.75)-qnorm(0.25))
  b = quantile(w,0.25) - m*qnorm(0.25)
  abline(b, m, lty=2, col="red") # Line through Q1 & Q3
}
```

# Comparing Base implementations

```{r, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))     #  Two plots in one window
par(pty="s")          #  Square plots

qqnorm(x)             # Base R first
qqline(x,lty=2,col="blue")

qqn(x)                # Our Plot
```

# `ggplot2` implementation

```{r, fig.height = 4}
df_x = as.data.frame(x)
n = nrow(df_x)
m = (quantile(x,0.75)-quantile(x,0.25))/
      (qnorm(0.75)-qnorm(0.25))
b = quantile(x,0.25) - m*qnorm(0.25)
g = ggplot(df_x, aes(sample=x)) + 
      stat_qq() +
      geom_abline(intercept = b,
                  slope = m,
                  color = "purple") +
      xlab("Theoretical Quantiles") +
      ylab("Sample Quantiles") +
      ggtitle("Normal Q-Q Plot")
```


# `ggplot2` implementation

```{r, echo = F}

# `ggplot2` implementation

```{r}
g + theme_dark() # Welcome to the dark side!
