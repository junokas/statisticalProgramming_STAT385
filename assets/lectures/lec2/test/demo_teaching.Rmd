# Let's Do Some R

In this case, we want to investigate the volume of discharge of the Nile river in Egypt. 

To do so, we should probably:

1. Load the data
2. Run a quick analysis

```{r nile_data, cache = T, echo = F}
y = datasets::Nile   # Loaded the data set from datasets

obs = length(y)      # Get the Length of Data
```

The amount of observations is: `r obs`. I obtained this using the `length()` function.


What does our data look like?

```{r nile_plot, cache = T, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center"}
plot(y)              # Plot the data
```

What would happen if we tried to model the data using time as our explanatory variable? 
```{r}
x = (1:obs)          # Create a time index
model = lm(y ~ x)    # Perform a simple linear regression (SLR)

model                # View model estimates
```

```{r}
plot(x, y, type='l') # Plot the model (note time index)
points(fitted(model), col='pink') # Plot the fitted values from the model
```

Let's take a look at how well the model performs by running some inference upon it:
```{r}
summary(model)       # View model summary
```
