    - Students pick themselves. Someone feels left out.
    - What about an Algorithm? 

## Stable Marriage Problem

- There is a fantastic TV documentary exploring algorithms on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) called: [The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms](https://www.netflix.com/title/80095881)

- Within it, the details of the [Stable Marriage algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) used in Medical School residency pairings and on Dating Websites is described.

## Grouping Today

- Our algorithm will try to optimize the following criteria:
    - Leadership style
    - Schedule
    - Skills
    - Project Interest
    
    
## Moving along...

Up next, we're going to learn about implementing a **variance estimator**! 
   
## Computational Statistics and the Variance Estimator

- **Computational Statistics**, the red-headed step child between statistics and computer science, has worked time and time again to obtain an algorithm for calculating *variance*.
- Yes, **variance.**

## Why is the algorithm for variance complicated? 

Consider the definitions of **Mean** and the **Variance**:

$$\begin{aligned}
\bar x &= \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} } \\
{\sigma ^2} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { { {\left( { {x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2} }
\end{aligned}$$

Note that the algorithm for the variance relies upon a version of the "Sum of Squares", e.g.

\[{S_{xx} } = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { { {\left( { {x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2} } \]

That is:

\[ {\sigma ^2} = \frac{1}{n}{S_{xx} } \]

## Sum of Squares

**Sum of Squares** provides a measurement of the total variability of a data set by squaring each point and then summing them.

$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}$$

More often, we use the **Corrected Sum of Squares**, which compares each data point to the mean of the data set to obtain a deviation and then square it.

$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { { {\left( { {x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2} }$$

## Why do we use the corrected Sum of Squares?

- When we talk about Sum of Squares it will always be the *corrected* form.

- The question for today is: **Why?**

## Arithmetic Overflow

Using the initial (uncorrected) Sum of Squares definition is sure to cause an **arithmetic overflow** when working with large numbers, for example:

```{r overflow_integer, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
(x = (1.0024e6)^2)               # Uncorrected
(y = (1.0024e6 - 1.0000156e6)^2) # Corrected
```

If we were to add to `x`, we would hit *R*'s 32-bit integer limit (see `?integer`):

```{r max_integer, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
.Machine$integer.max  # Maximum integer in memory
```


## Arithmetic Overflow - Behind the Scenes

*R* > 3.0, will try to address this behind the scenes by automatically converting the `integer` to a `numeric` with precision:

```{r max_double, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
.Machine$double.xmax  # Maximum numeric in memory
```

## Arithmetic Overflows and Big Data

- Within *Big Data* this problem may be more transparent as the information summarized is larger.

- Thus, you may need to use an external package for very big numbers. I would recommend the following:
    - [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/index.html)
    - [bit64](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bit64/bit64.pdf)

## Forms of the Variance Estimator

- Two-Pass Algorithm Form:

\[{\sigma ^2} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { { {\left( { {x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2} } \]

- Naive Algorithm Form:

\[{\sigma ^2} = \frac{ {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - { {\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} } } \right)}^2}/n} }{n}\]




## Sum of Squares Manipulation for Naive version
I'm opting to simply show the $S_{xx}$ modification instead of working with $\sigma ^2$ since it just scales the term by $\frac{1}{n}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
  S_{xx} &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { { {\left( { {x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2} } & \text{Definition} \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\left( {x_i^2 - 2{x_i}\bar x + { {\bar x}^2} } \right)} & \text{Expand the square}  \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar x\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} }  + { {\bar x}^2}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n 1 & \text{Split Summation} \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar x\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} }  + \underbrace {n{ {\bar x}^2} }_{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n c  = n \cdot c} & \text{Separate the summation} \notag \\
  &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar x\left[ {n \cdot \frac{1}{n} } \right]\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} }  + n{ {\bar x}^2}  & \text{Multiple by 1} \notag \\
\end{aligned}$$

## Sum of Squares Manipulation for Naive version - Cont.

$$\begin{aligned}
  S_{xx}   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar x\left[ {n \cdot \frac{1}{n} } \right]\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} }  + n{ {\bar x}^2}  & \text{Multiple by 1} \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar xn \cdot \underbrace {\left[ {\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n { {x_i} } } \right]}_{ = \bar x} + n{ {\bar x}^2}& \text{Group terms for mean}  \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2\bar xn\bar x + n{ {\bar x}^2} & \text{Substitute the mean} \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - 2n{ {\bar x}^2} + n{ {\bar x}^2} & \text{Rearrange terms} \notag \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {x_i^2}  - n{ {\bar x}^2} & \text{Simplify} \\ 
\end{aligned}$$


## Implementing Naive Variance

```{r var_algo_naive, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
var_naive = function(x){
  n = length(x)           # Obtain the length
  sum_x = 0               # Storage for Sum of X
  sum_x2 = 0              # Storage for Sum of X^2
  for(i in seq_along(x)){ # Calculate sums
    sum_x = sum_x + x[i]
    sum_x2 = sum_x2 + x[i]^2
  }
  
  # Compute the variance
  v = (sum_x2 - sum_x*sum_x/n)/n
  return(v)
}
```

## Implementing Two-Pass Variance

```{r var_algo_2p, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
var_2p = function(x){
  n  = length(x)           # Length
  mu = 0; v = 0            # Storage for mean and var
  
  for(i in seq_along(x)){  # Calculate the Sum for Mean
    mu = mu + x[i]         
  }
  
  mu = mu / n              # Calculate the Mean
  
  for(i in seq_along(x)){  # Calculate Sum for Variance
    v = v + (x[i] - mu)*(x[i] - mu)
  }
  
  v = v/n                  # Calculate Variance
  return(v)                # Return
}
```

## Calculations

```{r example_break, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(1234) # Set seed for reproducibility
x = rnorm(2e6, mean = 1e20, sd = 1e12)

(method1 = var_naive(x))
(method2 = var_2p(x))
(baser = var(x)*((2e6)-1)/(2e6))

all.equal(method1, method2)
all.equal(method2, baser)
```


## *R*'s Implementation

*R* opts to implement this method using a two-pass approach.

- There are quite a few papers on this topic going considerably far back. See [Algorithms for Computing the Sample Variance: Analysis and Recommendations (1983)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2683386?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) 

## $1 + 1 \neq 2$

Computers in all their infinite wisdom and ability are not perfect. One of the particularly problematic areas of computers is handling **numeric** or **float** data types.  Consider:

```{r numeric_example, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
x = 0.1
x = x + 0.05
x
if(x == 0.15){
  cat("x equals 0.15")
} else { 
  cat("x is not equal to 0.15")
}
```

**Why isn't `x` equal to 0.15!?**


## 


[![](img/meme_not_how_it_works.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/v/Aq_1l316ow8?start=0&end=21)



## Enter: Numerical Stability

In essence, *R* views the two numbers differnetly due to rounding error during the computation:

```{r numeric_string, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
sprintf("%.20f", 0.15) # Formats Numeric
sprintf("%.20f", x)    
```

## $\epsilon$ neighborhood 

Specifically, we are hitting a machine tolerance fault given by an $\epsilon$ neighborhood.

```{r epsilon_neighborhood, out.width = "250px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("img/epsilon_neighborhood.png")
```

The value of the $\epsilon$ is given by:

```{r machine_eps_neighborhood, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
.Machine$double.eps
```

This gives us the ability to compare up to `1e-15` places accurately.

```{r eps_example, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
sprintf("%.15f", 1 + c(-1,1)*.Machine$double.eps)
```

## Discrete Solution Check

To get around rounding error between two objects, we add a tolerance parameter to check whether the value is in the $\epsilon$ neighborhood or not.

```{r all_equal_example, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
all.equal(x, 0.15, tolerance = 1e-3)
```


## Discrete Solution Check

Since `all.equal` may not strictly return `TRUE` or `FALSE`, it is highly advisable to wrap it in `isTRUE()`, e.g.

```{r is_true_value, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
isTRUE(all.equal(x, 0.15))
```

Thus, in an `if` statement, you would use:
```{r is_true_numeric, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
if(isTRUE(all.equal(x, 0.15))){
  cat("In threshold")
} else {
  cat("Out of threshold")
}
```

## Bad Loop

To magnify the issue consider a loop like so:

```{r bad_loop_example, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
inc_value = 360L / 14L # Value to increment
i = 0                  # Increment storage
while(i != 360){       # Loop
  i = i + inc_value    # Add values
}
```

After 14 iterations, the loop should complete, but it does *not*! In fact, this loop will go onto infinity.

## Good Loop

To fix the looping issue, we opt to always stick with *integer*s as counters

```{r good_loop_example, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
inc_value = 360 / 14 # Value
i = 0L               # Integer
o = 0                # Numeric
while(i != 14L){
  o = o + inc_value  # Sum
  i = i + 1L         # Increment loop
}
i
```


## Summary

- Statistics and Computer Science rely on each greatly in this Brave New World of Data Science.
- When working with big numbers, understand that arithmetic overflow is a reality.
- **Never, ever, ever** use a floating-point representation as an incrementor for a loop. 
    - Always use an `integer` for an incrementor and then convert it to a `numeric` within a function.
- This topic **will** come up again when we switch to using `Rcpp`.

## Coming up next....

Common *R* errors... 

## Checking for Equality vs. Assignment

The most common error by far that affects programmers is making an assignment when trying to check for equality (and vice versa)

```{r if_assignment_error, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Assigning in `if`
if(x = 42) { cat("Life!") }
## Error: unexpected '=' in "if(x ="   

# Correct
if(x == 42) { cat("Life!") } 
```

```{r assignment_error, cache = T, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Equality Check instead of Assignment
x == 42
## No Error, but prints `TRUE` or `FALSE`

# Correct
x = 42
```

## `if` vectorization usage

As emphasis on vectorization grows, there is a tendency to compare two vectors using the default `if()` instead of `ifelse()`

```{r if_vectorized, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x = 1:5
y = 2:6
if(x > y){ T }
## Warning messages: 
## In if (x > y) { : the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

# Correct
ifelse(x > y, T, F)
```

## Vector Recycling

Sometimes the length of vectors are not equal or the data does not divide evenly or oddly when perform a vectorized computation.

```{r calc_vectorized, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x = 1:5
y = 2:3

x + y
## Warning message: 
## In x + y : longer object length is not a multiple 
## of shorter object length

# Correct
x = 1:4
y = 2:3
x + y   
# Repeats y twice 
# 1 + 2, 2 + 3, 3 + 2, 4 + 3
```

## Mismatched curly brackets `{}` or parentheses `()`

Often it is ideal to use parentheses for order of operations or curly brackets `{}`, though this sometimes causes a mismatch.

```{r mismatched_brackets, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
2*(x + y))
## Error: unexpected ')' in "2*(x + y))"

# Corrected
2*((x + y))
```

## No Multiplication

When working on computations, sometimes we just "slip" and opt not to write a multiplication sign thinking the interpreter can understand the context. 

```{r no_multiplication, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
2x+4
## Error: unexpected symbol in "2x"

# Correct
2*x + 4
```

## Manual Data Entry

Sometimes it's easier as we'll see next week to manually enter data. The issue with this is sometimes you forget simple things like a `,`.

```{r manual_entry, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
c(1, 2 3, 4)
## Error: unexpected numeric constant in "c(1,2 3"

# Correct
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```


## Strings in character values

At times, there may come a need to place a quotation inside of a string. To do this, requires using an escape character `\` or using `''` instead. 
```{r quoting_string, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
"toad"princess"
## Error: unexpected symbol in ""toad"princess"

# Corrected
"toad\"princess"
'toad"princess'
```

## Handling Missing Value Operations

The `NA` character indicates the presence of a missing value. These missing values can play havoc with computations.

```{r missing_values_issues, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x = c(1,NA,2)
3 + x
# No Error, but: [1] NA

sum(x)
# No Error, but: [1] NA

# Corrected
1 + na.omit(x)    # Deletes NA
sum(x, na.rm = T) # Removes NA inside function
```

## Finiteness of Values

R can have some funky finiteness problems due to how `NA` values are created.

```{r finite_missing_values, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x = c(NA,-Inf, Inf ,NaN)
is.na(x)
# No error, but: [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

is.infinite(x)
# No error, but: [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

# Correct
is.finite(x)
# [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

## Summary of Errors

- There are many odd errors that *R* can cause. 
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is a great community to ask questions about errors.
- When dealing with `NA` values, be on your guard!
