# Moving along...

- Last administration update. Any questions? 
- Moving along to... **Unix Shell**!

# Bash (Unix Shell)

- `GNU` is a free software environment that stands for "GNU's Not Unix"
- `Bourne-Again` Shell (`bash`) written by **Brian Fox** for the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.en.html)
    - Used on most Linux operating systems and on macOS.
    - Released in 1989

# Accessing `bash` in *RStudio*

- By default, this is included in RStudio:
     - `Tools` $\Rightarrow$ `Shell...`

```{r access_shell, out.width = "125px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/access_shell.png")
```

- **Note:** This may not be the case on Windows as you may only receive
the command line prompt.

# Grab a copy of `bash`

- If on Windows, you may need to...
     - Install **[`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** outside of `GitHub Desktop` to 
have the `bash` shell. 
     - **[Download  and Install `cygwin` on Windows](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/installing-amazon-web-services-command-line-interface-aws-cli-for-windows-os-x-and-linux-2/)**
          - Follow the windows specific instructions... Skip over the AWS parts!

# Bash Prompt

When logged into `bash` it is traditional to see on the left hand side:

```{bash, eval = F}
[username@hostname directory]$
```

In my case, I have:

```{bash, eval = F}
[balamut2@taubh2 ~]$
```

- The `~` means "home directory" or `/home/username`


# Unix Prompt commands

- **Syntax:** `command [option] [source file(s)] [target file]`
    - Options often have the `-x` or `--xxx` format
    - Use `Tab` to autocomplete source file / target file name.
    
- Advanced usage
    - Chain operations together via pipe operator `|` 
    - Execute command next if previous one succeeds using `&&`
    - Redirect operators `<`, `>`, `>>`, `2>` for input/output/error  
    
# Useful Unix Commands - Directories

| Command    | Description               | Example
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `pwd`      | Print working directory   | `pwd`                               |
| `cd`       | Change directory          | `cd dir/new` **or** `cd ../`        |
| `ls`       | List files                | `ls ~/` **or** `ls -la new/`        | 
| `mkdir`    | Make directory            | `mkdir test` **or** `mkdir -p mr/r` |
| `rmdir`    | Remove directory          | `rmdir test` **or** `rmdir -p mr/r` |


# Unix Commands - `pwd` - Print working directory

```{bash}
pwd
```

# Unix Commands - `cd` - Change directory

```{bash}
cd ../ && pwd # Go one directory up
```

```{bash}
cd ~/ && pwd # Go to base directory
```

# Unix Commands - `ls` - List Files

```{bash}
ls ~/BoxSync/stat385               # List files
```

```{bash}
ls -l ~/BoxSync/stat385 | grep lec # List files with lec
```

# Unix Commands - `mkdir` - Make Directory

- Use `mkdir` to create a new folder for a project.

```{bash}
mkdir test       # Make directory in `pwd`
```


- Adding the `-p` option allows for **all folders to be made** if not 
already present.

```{bash}
mkdir -p new/dir # The -p makes all directories
```


# Unix Commands - `rmdir` - Remove directory

- Use `rmdir` to remove or delete a folder.

```{bash}
rmdir test       # Remove directory
```

- Including the `-p` option allows for all directory structures to be **removed**.

```{bash}
rmdir -p new/dir # The -p recursively removes
```


# Useful Unix Commands - File Manipulation

| Command    | Description               | Examples                       |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|

| `grep`     | Regex find                | `grep "toad"`                  |

# Unix Commands - `touch` - Touch

```{bash, eval = F}
ls -l | grep "file.R" # File does not exist

# empty return
```

```{bash}
touch file.R          # Create File

ls -l | grep "file.R" # Check for existence
```

# Unix Commands - `vi` - File Editor in Terminal

```{bash, eval = F}
vi file.R # Open file
```

- Navigating `vi`
    - Press `I` to insert new characters.
    - To save changes, press `Esc` and type `:w` 
    - To exit, press `Esc` and type `:q!` 
    - To do both at the same time use `:wq!`
    
- Resources:
    - **[Interactive `vim` tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)**
    - Try the **[vim game](http://vim-adventures.com/)** for practice 
    - **[`vi` Reference guide](http://vim.rtorr.com/)**


**Note:** `vim` is the sucessor to `vi` and still is applicable. 

# Unix Commands - Using redirection to write to file

- Redirecting output into file
```{bash}
echo "line 1" >> file.R
echo "line 2" >> file.R
```

- Using **[`heredoc format`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document)**
to write multiple lines to file:
```{bash}
cat <<EOF >> file.R
line 3
line 4
line 5
line 6
EOF
```

- Note the following:
    - `>` outputs to a file
    - `>>` appends to a file
    - `<` reads input from file.

# Unix Commands - `cat` - See file contents

```{bash}
cat file.R     # Show file contents
```

# Unix Commands - File Permissions

- File permissions are a bit complicated but a necessary force.
- File permissions indicate whether someone can:

| Type      | Description               | Value | Character |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|-----------|
|**Execute**| Run a file                | 1     | `x`       |
|**Write**  | Save to a file            | 2     | `w`       |
|**Read**   | See what a file contains. | 4     | `r`       |


# Unix Commands - File Permissions for User Type

- Each type can be added together to customize the access level
    - For example: 7 would give all permissions, 5 gives only read and write.
- There are **three** types of permissions that can be assigned:

| Type      | Description                  | Position | Character |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------|-----------|
|**User**   | Owner or user                | First    | `u`       |
|**Group**  | Those that belong to a group | Second   | `g`       |
|**World**  | Everyone.                    | Third    | `a`       |


# Unix Commands - `chmod` - Set File Permissions

```{bash, eval = F}
chmod 777 file.R      # Everyone can read, write, access

chmod u+wxr file.R    # Only owner can read, write, access
```



# Unix Commands - `head` - See top content

```{bash}
head -2 file.R   # Show top 2 lines
```

- The `-2` limits it to the **top** 2 observations

# Unix Commands - `tail` - See bottom content

```{bash}
tail -1 file.R   # Show last line
```

- The `-1` limits it to the **last** observation


# Unix Commands - `cp` - Copy File

```{bash}
cp file.R file.R.bck # Create a back up
```

```{bash}
ls -l | grep ".bck"  # Check that it is there
```

- It is good practice to create `.bck` up files
- This is especially the case if you are working with 
configuration files (e.g. `.conf`)

# Unix Commands - `mv` - Move File

```{bash}
mv file.R.bck file_in_use.R        # Rename file
```

```{bash}
mv file_in_use.R img/file_in_use.R # Move to new directory
```


# Unix Commands - `rm` - Remove file

```{bash}
rm file.R            # Remove file
```

```{bash}
# Remove file in different directory
rm img/file_in_use.R 
```

# Unix Commands - `echo` - Display `bash` variables

```{bash}
samplevar="Hi stat385"    # Create a variable

echo $samplevar           # Print variable
```

Note the following:

- No space between variable, assignment operator, and value.
- The use of `$` to refer to the variable in `echo`.

# Moving along...

- And that's it for **Unix Shell**, any questions?  
- Onto... **Distributed Computing**!

# What is ICC?

- [Illinois Campus Cluster (ICC)](campuscluster.illinois.edu/), there are two 
unique systems: Taub and Golub. The latter is a newer deployment (2013 vs. 2011).
- There are presently about **530+ computing nodes available for use**.
- The *Statistics department* has:
     - **eight nodes (160 cores available)** 
     - a **maximum job runtime (walltime) of 336 hours** in `stat` queue.
- One can submit a job on the secondary queue with a maximum walltime of 4 hours
with up to 208 nodes (on either Taub or Golub).

# ICC Specs

- Nodes on **Golub** are configured with:
     - Two 2.5 GHz Haswell (Intel E5-2680V3) processors 
     (12 cores each for 24 cores per node),
     - two 1 TB SATA disk drives,
     - 4x Gigabit Ethernet connection, and
     - either 64, 128, or 256GB RAM depending on the owner’s choice.

- Nodes on **Taub** are configured with:
     - Two Intel HP X5650 2.66Ghz 6C Processors
     - HP 160GB or 500GB 3G SATA 7.2K 3.5in QR ETY HDD
     - HP IB Enablement Kit, and
     - either 12, 24, 48, or 96GB RAM owner’s choice.

# Structure of ICC

```{r cc_diagram, out.width = "275px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cc-diagram.png")
```


# Node Structure

Two types of nodes: 

- **Head nodes:** Login area from your laptop/desktop and a staging area (few)
- **Compute nodes:** Nodes that handle the computation from user jobs (many)


# Connecting to ICC

- To work with ICC, we first need to connect to the **head node** using **Secure Shell**, 
more commonly known as: `ssh`

- Example login: 

```{bash, eval = F}
ssh netid@cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu
# Enter password
```

- Mine: 

```{bash, eval = F}
ssh balamut2@cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu
# nottelling 
```

# Setting up ICC for *R*

```{bash, eval = F}
# Create a directory for your R packages 
# Note: This counts against your 2 GB home dir limit on ICC
mkdir ~/Rlibs

# Load the R modulefile 
# You may want to specify version e.g. R/3.2.2
module load R

# Set the R library environment variable (R_LIBS) to include your R package directory   
export R_LIBS=~/Rlibs

# See the path
echo $R_LIBS
```

- Always load *R* via `module load`. Otherwise, *R* will **not** be available.

# Permanently setup *R* home library

- To ensure that the `R_LIBS` variable remains set even after logging out
run the following command to permanently add it to the environment
     - e.g. this modifies your the `.bashrc` file, which is loaded on startup.

```{bash, eval = F}
cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc
  if [ -n $R_LIBS ]; then
      export R_LIBS=~/Rlibs:$R_LIBS
  else
      export R_LIBS=~/Rlibs
  fi
EOF
```

# Install *R* packages into home library

```{bash, eval = F}
# Use the install.packages function to install your R package.  
$ Rscript -e "install.packages('devtools',
              '~/Rlibs', 'http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/')"

# Use devtools to install package
$ Rscript -e "devtools::install_github('SMAC-Group/gmwm')"

# Devtools install from secret repo
$ Rscript -e "devtools::install_github('stat385/netid',
                                       subdir='secretpkg',
                                       auth_token = 'abc')"
```

- Watch the use of `'` and `"`! 
- For `auth_token` obtain a **[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)**

# Transforming Data to and Fro ICC

- Within `bash`, there exists **Secure Copy** or `scp` that enables the
transfer of files to ICC.

```{bash, eval = F}
# Transferring a file on your local system to your
# home directory on the Campus Cluster:
[user@local ~]$
scp local.txt My_NetID@cc-login....edu:~/
```

```{bash, eval = F}
# Transferring a file in your home directory on the
# Campus Cluster to your local system:
[user@local ~]$ 
scp My_NetID@cc-login....edu:~/remote.txt ./
```

- **Note:** To transfer an entire folder use: `scp -r` 
- Full URL is: `cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu`
- See **[Graphical Upload Guide](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/user_info/doc/beginner.html#data)**
for an alternative.

# Simulating $n$ obs from $N(\mu, 1)$

- To motivate the cluster usage, we'll opt for a straightforward example.
- The goal is to be able to simulate different number of observations $n$ from a 
Normal Distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$. 
- The exercise in itself could easily be condensed into the following short
*R* script:

```{r eval = F}
n = 20              # Same 20
mu = 5              # Mean of 5
set.seed(111)       # Set seed for reproducibility
rnorm(n, mean = mu) # Generate Observations
```

# Understanding a Job on ICC

- In the simpliest job, there are only two "working" parts:
     - `sim_runner.R`: Script governing the desired computations.
     - `sim_job.pbs`: Controls how the job is executed on the cluster
- This setup assumes that you have no external data file to be read in or
specific parameter configurations to test.

# Writing `sim_runner.R`

- Place `sim_runner.R` in your home directory `~/`

```{r eval = F}
# Expect command line args at the end. 
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

# Skip args[1] to prevent getting --args

# Extract and cast as numeric from character
rnorm(n = as.numeric(args[2]), mean = as.numeric(args[3]))
```


# Writing a PBS File `sim_job.pbs`: Part 1

```{bash, eval = F}
#!/bin/bash
#
## Set the maximum amount of runtime to 4 Hours
#PBS -l walltime=04:00:00
## Request one node with `nodes` and one core with `ppn`
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1
#PBS -l naccesspolicy=singleuser
## Name the job
#PBS -N job name
## Queue in the secondary queue
#PBS -q secondary
## Merge standard output into error output
#PBS -j oe
#####################################
```

- Standard job template.
- Change the `ppn` to increase the number of processors allowed if using
parallelization.

# Writing a PBS File `sim_job.pbs`: Part 2

```{bash, eval = F}
## Grab the job id from an environment variable 
## and create a directory for the data output
export JOBID=`echo "$PBS_JOBID" | cut -d"[" -f1`
mkdir $PBS_O_WORKDIR/"$JOBID"

## Switch directory into job ID (puts all output here)
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR/"$JOBID"

# Load R
module load R

## Run R script in batch mode without file output
Rscript $HOME/sim_runner.R --args 5 10
```

- This calls the `sim_runner.R` file and setups a working directory for the job
to be run on.

# Run the job!

- Submit your job using `qsub`

```{bash, eval = F}
qsub sim_job.pbs
```

- Check job status with `qstat`

```{bash, eval = F}
qstat -u netid
```

- Or visit the **[Campus Cluster Status](campuscluster.illinois.edu/status/)**
page.

# Using an Array Job

- Previously, we only ran one job with one reptition.
- In practice, we may want to run multiple reptitions across different seeds
to evaluate stability or try a combination of different parameters. 
- As a result, it would be highly inefficient if we constantly updated and
submitted a job runner file (e.g. `sim_runner.R`) with each value.
- Instead, we opt to use something called an Array Job that allows us to 
submit multiple jobs. 

# Understanding an Array Job on ICC

- For an Array Job, there are three important parts:
     - `inputs.txt`: List of parameter values to use.
     - `sim_runner_array.R`: Script governing the desired computations.
     - `sim_array_job.pbs`: Controls how the job is executed on the cluster
- Note: We only added `inputs.txt` vs. the standard job configuration.

# Modification to enable job array in `.pbs` file

- To enable a job array, add the following into the top of the `.pbs` file:

```{bash, eval = F}
## Run with job array indices 1 through 6. 
#PBS -t 1-6
```

- These indices are used below to get theright lines from the input file


# Modification to `.pbs` file

- Change step size with `:n`, e.g.

```{bash, eval = F}
#PBS -t 1-10:2
## gives 1,3,5,7,9
```

# Array Job PBS File `sim_array_job.pbs`: Part 1

```{bash, eval = F}
#!/bin/bash
#
## Set the maximum amount of runtime to 4 Hours
#PBS -l walltime=04:00:00
## Request one node with `nodes` and one core with `ppn`
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1
#PBS -l naccesspolicy=singleuser
## Name the job
#PBS -N job name
## Queue in the secondary queue
#PBS -q secondary
## Run with job array indices 1 through 6. 
#PBS -t 1-6
## Merge standard output into error output
#PBS -j oe
#####################################
```


# Array Job PBS File `sim_array_job.pbs`: Part 2

```{bash, eval = F}
export JOBID=`echo "$PBS_JOBID" | cut -d"[" -f1`
mkdir $PBS_O_WORKDIR/"$JOBID"

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR/"$JOBID"

module load R

## Grab the appropriate line from the input file.  
## Put that in a shell variable named "PARAMS"
export PARAMS=`cat ${HOME}/inputs.txt |
               sed -n ${PBS_ARRAYID}p`

## Run R script based on the array number. 
Rscript $HOME/sim_job.R --args $PARAMS
```


# Customize the parameters with an `input.txt` file.

- To customize the job, opt for an `input.txt` file via:

```{bash, eval = F}
0 1
2 3.3
9 2.3
.. ..
42 4.8
```

- Note: Each line corresponds to an array ID!!

# Job Array - `sim_runner_array.R` 

```{r eval = F}
# Expect command line args at the end. 
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

# Skip args[1] to prevent getting --args

# Obtain the ID being accessed from the array
jobid = as.integer(Sys.getenv("PBS_ARRAYID"))

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(jobid)

# Extract and cast as numeric from character
rnorm(n = as.numeric(args[2]), mean = as.numeric(args[3]))
```


# Misc: Lots of ways to structure input args

In addition to `Base R`, there are many different options on CRAN to create
correctly structured file inputs.

- getopt
- optparse
- argparse
- docopt
- argparser
- minimist
- optigrab
