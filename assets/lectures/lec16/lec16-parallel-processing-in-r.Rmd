# Parallel Computing

> "For over a decade prophets have voiced the contention that the organization
of a single computer has reached its limits and that truly significant advances 
can be made only by interconnection of a multiplicity of computers."

# Revisiting Oxen vs. Chicken

**Recall:**

- Before the chickens were equally as powerful just not **united** well.
- How can we **unite** the power of that many chickens? 

# Types of Processing

There are three types of processing:

1. Serial
2. Parallel
3. Hybrid (both approaches)

# What is Serial Processing?

**Definition:**

- *Serial Processing* is a method of sequentially working on tasks.
- Only one task may be worked upon at a time. 
- After that task is finished, the next task is then worked upon.

```{r serial_processing, out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/serial_processing.pngs")
```

# Serial Example - Loop

Here is a typical serial processing with a `for` loop.

```{r}
n = 10000                          # Number of obs
x = numeric(n)                     # Set up storage
system.time({
  for(i in seq_along(x)){          # For loop
    x[i] = pf(i, df1 = 4, df2 = 5)    
  }
})
```

# Serial Example - Vectorization

Here is a typical serial processing with for 

```{r}
n = 10000                        # Number of obs
system.time({
  x = pf(1:n, df1 = 4, df2 = 5)  # Pre-vectorized
})
```

# Timing As Expected...

- Given the work previously done, the `for` loop is a bit slower than the
vectorized component. 
- The reason for this is due to *R* evaluating the vectorization
at a low *C* level vs. high level interpretation.
- Though, there is a common misconception that vectorization evaluates 
items in a non-sequential manner... **That simply isn't true.**


# Vectorization is sequential - Waiting for Godot...

Vectorization will still lead to waiting for the 
items to be sequentially evaluated. e.g.

```{r serial_wait}
# Wrapper function for use in *apply
wait = function(i) {
  function(x){ Sys.sleep(i) }
}

# 10 iterations * .25 seconds = 2.5 seconds elapsed
system.time({ sapply(1:10, wait(0.25)) }) 
```

# Parallel Lingo

**Cluster**:

A cluster is a set of computers that are connected together and share resources as if they were one gigantic computer.

```{r rpi_cluster, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rpicluster.jpg")
```

# Parallel Lingo Cont.

**Master (Primary):**

The head computer that controls operations on the cluster.

**Slave / Worker (Secondary):**

Computers that performs computations given to them by the master.

```{r head_vs_workers, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/head_vs_workers.png")
```

# What is Parallel Processing?

**Definition:**

- *Parallel Processing* is the act of carrying out multiple tasks simultaneously to solve a problem. 
- This is accomplished by dividing the problem into independent subparts,
which are then solved concurrently.

```{r parallel_processing, out.width = "250px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parallel_processing.pngs")
```

# Parallel Paradigm - Industry

Parallelism is **everywhere** in the real world.

- CEOs distribute work to their employees, leave for a week, and then expect a
report on their desks.
- Architects distributing blueprints to construction workers who individually
work on sections of the building. 

# Parallel Paradigm - Academia

- Professors distribute ideas to graduate students, wait for them to solve
the ideas, then aggregate the results into a paper.

![[The Simpson S18E6 - Moe'N'A Lisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fM8ao0iXRE#t=12s)](img/simpsons_grad_workers.png)

# Before an example...

- To work with parallel features in *R* you need to subscribe to either
`doParallel` or `parallel` paradigm.
- Generally, `doParallel` approach is used
by novices and `parallel` is used by more advanced users.

```{r}
# Load doParallel, which will load parallel
require(doParallel, quiet = TRUE)

# How many cores do you have?
( cores = detectCores() )
```


# Before an example... quick parallelization.

To spawn our *workers*, we need to first create a cluster.

```{r}
# Start a cluster with that many cores
cl = makeCluster(cores)
```

After the cluster is created, some computation normally occurs and then the
cluster is stopped.

```{r}
# Stop the cluster
stopCluster(cl)
```

**>> Always remember to stop the cluster! <<**

# Parallel Example - Loop via `foreach`

Note the `for` in this case is `foreach`, which is a special looping function
introduced by `doParallel`.

```{r}
cl = makeCluster(3)    # Create snow Cluster
registerDoParallel(cl) # Register it with foreach
n = 10000              # Number of obs

# Use foreach in place of for to parallelize loop
system.time({   
                # Note the different loop syntax
  out = foreach(i = 1:n, .combine=rbind) %dopar% {
    pf(i, df1 = 4, df2 = 5)    
  }
})

stopCluster(cl) # Stop the cluster
```

# Parallel Example - Vectorization

Parallelized version of the vectorized `apply` function

```{r}
cl = makeCluster(3) # Create snow Cluster
n = 10000           # Number of obs

# Use parApply to parallelize apply.
system.time({
  out = parSapply(cl = cl,   # Cluster
                 X = 1:n,    # Data
                 FUN = pf,   # Function
                 df1 = 4,    # Function params
                 df2 = 5) 
})
stopCluster(cl) # Stop the cluster
```

# Parallel Example - Speed

- There is a considerable **speed** difference between the two parallelization
operations. 
- Part of the reason for this difference is the infrastructure setup of the 
`foreach` loop within the `doParallel` package. 
- The `foreach` loop really is a wrapper around the `parallel` components. 
    - <https://github.com/cran/doParallel/blob/master/R/doParallel.R#L469-L494>
- Hence, why more advanced users opt for pure `parallel` and
beginning users typically use `doParallel`. 


# Parallel vs. Sequential Example - Speed

- Note that the speed of the *sequential* apply in this case was about ~8.5 times
FASTER than that of the *parallel* operation.
- The **operation being performed is not computationally sufficient to
warrant parallelization** due to the time associated with setting up the
components.

# Waiting for Godot... Redux

Using the same `wait()` function as before, we opt to see what happens
under parallelization. 

```{r warning = F}
# Create snow Cluster
cl = makeCluster(4)

system.time({ 
  parLapply(cl = cl, X = 1:10, fun = wait(0.25))
})

# Stop the cluster
stopCluster(cl) 
```

# Distribution of Parallel Jobs

- Per the last example, note that the total amount of time spent was slightly
over 0.75 of a second. 
- The decrease in time was directly related to how the jobs were assigned.

```{r parallel_job_diag_4n, fig.cap="Job Creation with 4 Cores in Cluster", out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parallel_job_diag_4n.png")
```

# Distribution of Parallel Jobs

- What would happen if we added a 5th worker to the cluster?
     - What would be the runtime of the job?
     - How does the job structure change?

# Distribution of Parallel Jobs

- Adding a 5th worker would yield only two jobs and have a total runtime of 0.5
seconds instead of 0.75.

```{r parallel_job_diag_5n, fig.cap="Job Creation with 5 Cores in Cluster", out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parallel_job_diag_5n.png")
```

# Parallelization Problem Types

- Loosely coupled (Embarrassingly Parallel)
    - There is lots of *INDEPENDENCE* between computations. 
    - Very easy to parallelize
    - e.g. Tree growth step of random forest algorithm
- Tightly Coupled
    - Considerable amounts of *DEPENDENCE* exist among the computations.
    - Very hard if not impossible to parallelize. 
    - e.g. Gibbs Sampler

# General Parallelization Ideas

There are two ways to achieve parallelization:

- Explicit Parallelism
    - The user creates and controls the parallelization
    - a.k.a The user writes code that activates the parallelization.
    - Example: OpenMP and MPI
- Implicit Parallelism
    - The system handles it. 
    - a.k.a The user is clueless that parallelization is happening on their behalf!
    - Example: Arithmetic and Matrix related operations

# Explicit Parallelism: Shared Memory (OpenMP)

- **Shared memory** programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. 
- **OpenMP** provides an implementation of this shared memory variables framework.
      - The **master** thread forks a specified number of **slave** threads, with tasks divided among threads. 
      - Each thread executes parallelized sections of code independently. 

```{r shared_memory, out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/shared_memory.png")
```

# Explicit Parallelism: Distributed Memory (MPI)

- **Distributed Memory** uses message-passing APIs to coordinate how a job 
should be completed.

- **Message Passing Interface** (MPI) uses a master-slave communication model 
over a network to communicate with separate machines 
    - e.g the master sends instructions to the slave and the slave acts. 

```{r distributed_memory, out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/distributed_memory.png")
```

# Comparison of Explicit Parallelism


| Shared Memory           | Distributed Memory           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Open MP                 | MPI (send & receive)         |
| Multi-core Processors   | Distributed Network Required |
| Directive Based         | Message Based                |
| Easy to program & debug | Flexible and Expressive      |
| Requires memory         | Requires good communication  | 

# Amdahl's law (Fixed Problem Size)

Given:

- $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the number of processors being used
- $P \in \left[ {0,1} \right]$, the proportion of a program that can be made
parallel
- The problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work to be done in 
parallel is also independent of the number of processors

Then the maximum speedup obtainable via parallelization is:

$$S\left( N \right) = \frac{1}{ {\left( {1 - P} \right) + \frac{P}{N} } }$$

# Amdahl's law (Fixed Problem Size)


$$S\left( N \right) = \frac{1}{ {\left( {1 - P} \right) + \frac{P}{N} } }$$

Note, as $N \rightarrow \infty$, then: 

$$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{N \to \infty } S\left( N \right) = \frac{1}{ {1 - P} }$$

- This means that the maximum speedup with infinite amounts of processors
is restricted to $\left({1-P}\right)$. 
- Or the proportion that cannot be parallelized and, hence, is serial. 

# Gustafson's law (Scaled Speedup)

Given:

- $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the number of processors being used
- $\alpha \in \left[ {0,1} \right]$, the proportion of a program that can be made parallel
- The total amount of work to be done in parallel varies linearly with the number of processors

Then the maximum speedup obtainable via parallelization is:

$$S\left( N \right) = N - \alpha  \cdot \left( {N - 1} \right)$$


# Gustafson's law (Scaled Speedup)

- The fraction of time spent in sequential sections of the program sometimes 
depends on the problem size.
- That is, by scaling the problem size, you may improve the chances of speedup. 
- In application, this may yield more accurate  "speed up" results.

# Explicit Parallelization in R

- As stated earlier, packages we will be focusing on for converting R code are: 
`doParallel` (in turn `foreach`), and `parallel`. 
- These packages provide parallel scaffolding for Windows machines as well as *nix. 
- Note: The `parallel` package combines both `multicore` and `snow` packages.
     - **Unfortunately, `multicore` doesn't play nicely with Windows.**

# Parallelization Structure

Within the R script that is able to be parallelized, the structure that 
must be followed is:

```{r parallel_doc, out.width = "300px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parallel_doc.png")
```

# Poking around at `parallel`'s `snow` backend

Important functions for initializing a `parallel` computing environment with *R*. 

| Function                | Description                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `detectCores()`         | Detect the number of CPU cores |
| `makeCluster()`         | Sets up a cluster              |
| `stopCluster()`         | Stop the cluster from running  |
| `clusterSetRNGStream()` | Set seeds for reproducibility  |

# `parallel` examples

```{r}
# Load doParallel package
library(doParallel, quiet = TRUE) 

( cores = detectCores() ) # Number of Cores

cl = makeCluster(cores)   # Start Cluster

stopCluster(cl)           # Stop the cluster
```

# Poking around at `parallel`'s `snow` backend - Cont. 

Important functions for manipulating data with \textit{parallel}:

| Function                | Description                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `clusterCall()`         | Calls a function each node in the cluster  |
| `clusterApply()`        | Distribute function by vectorized args     |
| `clusterApplyLB()`      | Identical to above but uses load balancing |

- We're not going to worry about *load balancing*. However, I've added
in these slides at the end for those interested.

# Hello Parallel World

```{r}
hello.world = function(){ print("Hello Parallel World!") }

cl = makeCluster(3)  # Create snow Cluster

# Issue function to all threads
clusterCall(cl = cl, fun = hello.world)

stopCluster(cl)      # Stop cluster
```


# Low Level Functions

Subtle functions that are helpful for sending data to clusters:


| Function                | Description                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `clusterEvalQ()`        | Evaluating an expression on each node        |
| `clusterExport()`       | Export variables and functions to each node. |

# Loading a Package on Multiple Nodes

```{r}
cl = makeCluster(2)             # Create cluster for snow

clusterEvalQ(cl, library(gmwm)) # Load package on all nodes

stopCluster(cl)                 # Stop cluster
```

# Exporting Values to All Nodes

```{r}
cl = makeCluster(2)    # Create cluster for snow

x = 1:5                # Create variable on master

clusterExport(cl = cl, # Send variable to slaves
              varlist = c("x"))

stopCluster(cl)       # Stop cluster
```

Note: `varlist` requires a `character` vector of expression
names.

# Parallel `*apply()` functions

Within `parallel`, there are parallelized replacements of `lapply()`, 
`sapply()`, `apply()` and related functions.

- **`snow`:** 
    - `parLapply()`
    - `parSapply()`
    - `parApply()`
    - `clusterMap` (e.g. `mapply()`)
    
- **`multicore`:**
    - `mclapply()`
    - `mcmapply()` (e.g. `mapply()`)

# Parallel `*apply` functions

- `snow` also provides load balance versions of `parLapplyLB()` and `parSapplyLB()`
- There also column and row apply functions `parCapply` and `parRapply` to
avoid having to remember `MARGIN = 1` or `MARGIN = 2` in `parApply()`. 

# Sample *apply

```{r}
# regular apply
mat = matrix(1:100000, ncol=5)

system.time({
  apply(X = mat, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)
})
```

**Note:** There was a memory issue when it tried to mimic the parallelized version.


# Sample Parallelized *apply

```{r}
x = 1:10000000          # Data
mat = matrix(x, ncol=5) # Matrix form

cl = makeCluster(4)     # Create snow Cluster

system.time({           # Parallel Apply
  parApply(cl = cl, X = mat,
           MARGIN = 2, FUN = sum)
})

stopCluster(cl)         # Stop cluster
```


# `for` loops to vectorization

Embarrassly simple parallelization is akin to being able to convert from a 
for loop to a vectorized statement. Speed ups may vary.

```{r}
square_x = function(x){ # Squaring function
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    x[i] = x[i]^2
  }
  return(x)
}

x = 1:1e7                # Data

system.time({ 
  out = square_x(x)
})
```

# `for` loops to vectorization

The conversion of the prior `for` to a standard `*apply` statement would be:

```{r}
system.time({
  y = sapply(x, function(x) x^2) # 1-line call to apply
})
```

# Vectorization to Parallel Vectorization

To go from the **standard** vectorization to a **parallelized** vectorization
procedure only involves slight tweaks in the code.

```{r}
cl = makeCluster(4)

squared = function(x) { x^2 }

system.time({
  parSapply(cl = cl, X = x,
           FUN = squared)
})

# End cluster for snow
stopCluster(cl)
```


# Vectorized Parallelization

The bottom line:
$$ $$
**If a loop can be vectorized, then it is able to be parallelized.**


# Summary of `parallel`

- Combination of `snow` (all platforms) and `multicore` (unix only) packages
- Part of `Base R` since v2.14.0
- Small overhead vs. foreach loops (next)


# Extra Material: Load Balancing

Load balancing is an optimization of how to be best distribute jobs.

- If the length $p$ of the sequence is not greater than the number of nodes $n$, then a job is sent to $p$ nodes.
- Otherwise:
     - The first $n$ jobs are placed in order on the $n$ nodes.
     - So, there are $p-n$ jobs that need to be assigned. 
     - When the first job completes, the node receives the next job from the $p-n$ job pool.
     - This continues until all jobs are complete.
- **You gain speed but lose reproducibility this way!**
