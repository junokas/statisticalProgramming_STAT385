- Extra: Implicit Parallelism

# `foreach` and `do*`

- [RevolutionAnalytics](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/) has created very
nice wrapper functions that enable the conversion of R loop code to a 
parallelized version.
- Specifically, the `foreach` package implements parallelized looping. 
- Packages that have the prefix **`do`** correspond to a parallelization backend. (e.g. **`doParallel`**)
- **Using the parallel backend in turn makes loops faster!** \*under certain assumptions.

# `foreach` and `do*` - Assumptions

Faster loops come with a couple assumptions:

- There is no dependency within the loop.
- The calculation is not trivial.

Otherwise, the overhead associated with the parallelizing the loops will destroy any gain and possible make results slower to obtain.

# `foreach`

The syntax for a `foreach()` loop is slightly different than a `for()` loop:

```{r syntax_foreach, eval = FALSE}
# Foreach
foreach(i = 1:3) %do% { expression }

# Base R for loop
for(i in 1:3){ expression }
```

Note:

1. The `% %` after the `foreach` declaration and before the `{ }` is a
binary operator.
2. `i = 1:3` vs. `i in 1:3`

# `foreach` binary operators

- The `foreach` loop requires a binary operator be placed after it. 

- The binary operators are:

| Operator | Description                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `%do%`   | Sequential foreach loop (e.g. R's old loop) |
| `%dopar%`| Parallel foreach loop                       |
| `%dorng%`| Obtain reproducible randomization (requires [`doRNG` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doRNG/index.html)) |
| `%:%`    | Indicates a nested loop                     |

# Sample `foreach` loop

Here is a simple foreach loop. Note that the output is that of a list. 
```{r simple_foreach}
library("foreach")
foreach(i = 1:3) %do% { sqrt(i) }
```


# `foreach` Output Types

- By modifying `.combine=""`, the output shifts from being a list to being a vector.

- To store the results from the `foreach` loop, assign a variable to it!

```{r simple_foreach_output}
x = foreach(i = 1:3, .combine='c') %do% { sqrt(i) }

x
```

# `foreach` Output Types

Common `.combine=""` types:

- `c` for concatenating the results into a vector
- `cbind` for concatenating the results into a column-based matrix
- `rbind` for concatenating the results into a row-based matrix

# Warning!

This loop structure will NOT recycle values! Make sure your index and additional params are of the similar length

```{r warning_foreach}
x = foreach(a = 1:50, b = c(1,2), .combine='c') %do% {
  a + b
}

x
```

# Using Packages in Parallel

- In particular, with parallel code comes the necessity to load packages on all open threads. 

- To do so, use: `.packages=c('package_name')`

```{r packages_in_parallel, eval=F, size='scriptsize'}
# Loading packages on different workers
foreach(i = 1:3, .packages=c('gmwm')) %dopar% {
  expression 
}
```

# foreach setup - parallelization

```{r foreach_setup, size='scriptsize'}
require(doParallel, quiet = TRUE) # Load library

cl = makeCluster(2)    # Create cluster for snow

registerDoParallel(cl) # Register it with doParallel

getDoParWorkers()      # See how many workers exist

# Do a parallelized loop!
foreach(i = 1:3, .combine='c') %dopar% { sqrt(i) }

stopCluster(cl)        # End cluster for snow
```

# Nested `foreach`

- Often, there needs to be more than one loop active at a given time.
- Thus, ``nesting'' or placing one loop within another.


# Nested `foreach`

Below shows nesting in a sequential case with for and foreach loops.

```{r nested_for, size='tiny'}
# Standard R loop
out = character()
for(i in 1:3) {
  for(j in c("A","B")) {
    out = c(out,paste0(i,j))
  }
}
```

```{r nested_foreach, size='tiny'}
# Nested foreach loop
foreach(i = 1:3, .combine = c) %do% {
  foreach(j = c("A","B"), .combine = c) %do% {
    paste0(i, j)
  }
}
```


# Nested `foreach`

With foreach loops, you can only execute one loop out of the nested conditions 
in parallel. Thus, it is ideal if you set the ``overloop'' or the outer loop 
to be parallel.  

```{r nested_foreach_parallel1, size='tiny'}
cl = makeCluster(2)    # Create cluster for snow
registerDoParallel(cl) # Register cluster with doParallel

# foreach with overloop parallelized
foreach (i = 1:3, .combine = c, 
         .packages = 'foreach') %dopar% {
           
  foreach(j = c("A","B"), .combine = c) %do% {
    paste0(i, j)
  }
           
}

stopCluster(cl)   # End cluster for snow
```

# Nested `foreach`

```{r nested_foreach_parallel2, size='tiny'}
cl = makeCluster(2)    # Create cluster for snow

registerDoParallel(cl) # Register cluster with doParallel

# foreach with parallel using %:%
foreach (i = 1:3, .combine = c) %:% 
  foreach(j = c("A","B"), .combine = c) %dopar% {
    paste0(i, j)
  }

stopCluster(cl)        # End cluster for snow
```


# Reproducible Parallelization

- If the objective of your work is to make sure the results are reproducible, 
then it is important to set seeds. 

- However, setting a seed within the parallel code is not ideal since it assumes
the same job will be distributed to each core each time.

- **This is not true and a dangerous assumption**

- The solution? Establish a set of seeds ahead of time and pass them along with
the job.


# Reproducible `foreach`

To create a reproducible `foreach` loop, we need to

1. Set a seed with `registerDoRNG()`.
2. Use `%dorng%` from [`doRNG`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doRNG/index.html) package as the binary operator.

```{r parallel_foreach, size='scriptsize'}
library(doRNG)         # Load doRNG

cl = makeCluster(2)    # Create cluster for snow

registerDoParallel(cl) # Register cluster with doParallel

registerDoRNG(123)     # Register a set of seeds

# Run foreach loop
parallel = foreach(i = 1:5) %dorng% {
  runif(3)             # Sample from uniform
}

stopCluster(cl)        # End cluster for snow
```

# `foreach` Summary

- Make sure to register your backend via `registerDoParallel(cl)`
- The binary operator `%dopar%` or `%dorng%` must be used for a parallel `foreach`.
- `%do%`, `%dopar%`, or `%dorng%` must appear on the same line as the `foreach()` call.

# Application of Parallelization: Bootstrapping

- When we compute a statistic on the data, we only know that one statistic.
- As a result, we don't see how variable that statistic may be.
- To solve this conundrum, Efron proposed Bootstrapping in the now famous
1979 paper entitled: "Bootstrap methods: another look at the jackknife".
- This is a **loop** intensive operation that relies on creating data which
"we might have seen."


# Application of Parallelization: Bootstrapping

- The Bootstrapping approach necessitated the creation of a large number of 
datasets from the initial sample by randomly sampling observations
with replacement.
- Under this approach, data is generated so that it might of been obtained 
if we were able to collect data multiple times.
- On each of the data sets, the statistic is then computed leading to the
creation of a distribution ontop of the statistic. 


# A bootstrapping example with `for`...

```{r bootstrap_example_r, size='tiny'}
# Get Iris Data
x = iris[which(iris[,5] != "setosa"), c(1,5)]
B = 10000                           # Iteration
db = matrix(NA, nrow = 2, ncol = B) # Results

system.time({
  
   for(i in 1:B){                   # Loop
    ind = sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
    result = glm(x[ind,2] ~ x[ind,1],
                 family = binomial(logit))
    db[,i] = coefficients(result)
   }
  
})
```


# A bootstrapping example with `foreach` ....

```{r bootstrap_example_foreach_seq, size='tiny'}
x = iris[which(iris[,5] != "setosa"), c(1,5)]
B = 10000                 # Iteration

system.time({
  db = foreach(icount(B), .combine=cbind) %do% {
    ind = sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
    result = glm(x[ind,2] ~ x[ind,1],
                  family = binomial(logit))
    coefficients(result)
  }
})
```

# A bootstrapping example with parallelization...
To make the `foreach` loop parallel we:

1. Change `%do%` to `%dopar%`
2. Add a cluster creation and cluster stop call.

# A bootstrapping example with parallelization...

```{r bootstrap_example_foreach, size='tiny'}
x = iris[which(iris[,5] != "setosa"), c(1,5)]
B = 10000                # Bootstrap iterations

cl = makeCluster(4)      # Create Cluster with 4 cores
registerDoParallel(cl)   # Register cluster for foreach

system.time({
   db = foreach(icount(B), .combine=cbind) %dopar% {
     ind = sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
     result = glm(x[ind,2] ~ x[ind,1],
                  family=binomial(logit))
     coefficients(result)
     }
})
```

# Moving along...

- That's a wrap on using **foreach**... Any questions?
- Moving onto ... **Parallelizing with Rcpp**

# Parallelizing with Rcpp

- Before now, we've discussed how to parallelize components using the R language. 
- Sometimes, it is a bit more ideal to use C++ to write algorithms (e.g. lots of loops).  

- In this case, we'll talk about using [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/mp-documents/OpenMP4.0.0.Examples.pdf) with [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) or its many variants:
     - [RcppArmadillo](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html).
     - [RcppEigen](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppEigen/index.html).
- Recently, there has been the addition of [RcppParallel](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppParallel/index.html). 
     - But, this addition is more dependent on code functioning within the R ecosystem.


# C++ Pragma Directives
The pragma directive is used to access compiler-specific preprocessor extensions.

```{Rcpp out, eval=F}
#pragma compiler specific extension
```

- These options are specific for the platform and the compiler you use. 
- If the compiler does not support a specific argument for \#pragma, then it is ignored with \textbf{no syntax error generated}.
- Look at the manual for your compiler for a list of parameters that you can define with \#pragma.

# Pragma Directive and OpenMP

- Pragma directives are heavily used by OpenMP.
- The directives serve to generate parallelization code. 
- Specifically, to parallelize a loop, they are invoked in the form of:

```{Rcpp out2, eval=F}
unsigned int ncores = 2; // Number of CPUs

#pragma omp parallel num_threads(ncores) 
{
  #pragma omp for
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = a[i] + b[i];}
}
```

# Behind the pragma

When using:

```{Rcpp out3, eval=F}
#pragma omp parallel
```

The pragma directive is converted to:
```{Rcpp code_convert, eval = F}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  int this_thread, num_threads, istart, iend;
  id = omp_get_thread_num();
  num_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
  istart = this_thread * N / num_threads;
  iend = (this_thread + 1) * N / num_threads;
  if (this_thread == num_threads-1) { iend = N; }
}
```

So, pragma directives are short cuts or macros for writing code.


# Enabling OpenMP for Rcpp

To enable OpenMP support, we can set the required compiler and linker flags within R by:

```{r set_flags, eval=F}
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-fopenmp")
Sys.setenv("PKG_LIBS"="-fopenmp")
```

Or, using Rcpp $\ge$ 0.10.5, we can use a plugin within the C++ code to automatically set these variables for us:

```{Rcpp set_flags_c, eval=F}
// [[Rcpp::plugins(openmp)]]
```

# Enabling OpenMP for Rcpp

- The macOS operating environment lacks the ability to parallelize sections of code using the OpenMP standard.

- Typical error:

```{bash compile_flag, eval = F}
clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'
```

- Read **[OpenMP in R on macOS](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/openmp-in-r-on-os-x/)** to enable on macOS.

# Protecting OpenMP inclusion for macOS

- However, 99% of the users on macOS, will not have OpenMP enabled compilers.
- As a result, make sure to protect any reference to OpenMP. 
- Primarily, protect the inclusion of OpenMP headers with:

```{Rcpp include_openmp, eval = F}
#ifdef _OPENMP
   #include <omp.h>  // OpenMP header
#endif
```

- Doing so will enable the parallelization of the process on Linux and Windows. 
- In the event that Apple enables OpenMP later on, this code will also allow 
for parallelization to occur.

# Sample use of parallelized C++ loop

```{Rcpp sample_cpp_loop}
#include <Rcpp.h>
#ifdef _OPENMP
   #include <omp.h>  // OpenMP header
#endif
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::plugins(openmp)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void sample_loop(unsigned int n,
                 unsigned int ncores = 2)
{
  #pragma omp parallel num_threads(ncores)
  {
    #pragma omp for 
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; i++){
      // AWESOME_FUNCTION(i);
    }
  }
}
```

# Pragma shortcut

Put the `parallel` and the `for` directive on the same line! 

```{Rcpp sample_cpp_loop2, eval = F}
#include <Rcpp.h>
#ifdef _OPENMP
   #include <omp.h>  // OpenMP header
#endif
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::plugins(openmp)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
void sample_loop(unsigned int n,
                 unsigned int ncores = 2)
{
  #pragma omp parallel for num_threads(ncores) 
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n; i++){
     // AWESOME_FUNCTION(i);
  }
}
```

# Carried Loop Dependency

```{Rcpp carried_dependency_cpp_loop}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector odd_op(NumericVector x){
  unsigned int i, j, n;   // Declare variables
  n = x.size();           // Element size
  j = 1;                 
  
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
    j += 2;               // Dependency
    x[i] = x[i] + j;
  }
  
  return x;
}
```


# Removing Carried Loop Dependency

- Part of parallelizing requires the loop iterations to be independent.
- Sometimes all that is required is reparameterizing the iteration.

```{Rcpp carried_independence_cpp_loop, eval = F}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector odd_op_para(NumericVector x,
                          unsigned int ncores = 2){
  unsigned int i, n;
  n = x.size();
  
  #pragma omp parallel for num_threads(ncores)
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
    unsigned int j = 1 + 2*i; // indep
    x(i) = x(i) + j;
  }
  
  return x;
}
```


# Lowering Dependency: Part II
**Question:** How do you remove a dependency when you have to combine values 
into an accumulation variable?

```{Rcpp dependency_p2, size='tiny'}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double average(NumericVector x){
  unsigned int i, n;
  double sum = 0.0;
  n = x.size();
  
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += x(i);            // ewk!
  }
  return sum/n;
}
```

**Answer:** Use a reduction!

# Reductions

Reduction operations are the result of needing to combine variables into a single variable. e.g.
```{r reduc, eval=F}
var = var op expr 
```

Requirements for a reduction

1. `var` must be a scalar
1. `expr` a scalar that does not reference var
1. `op` an operation that is either $+$, $*$, or $-$

Pragma directive for reduction:

```{Rcpp reduction, eval=F}
#pragma omp parallel for reduction (op:variable)
```


# Reduction in Action

The reduction is able to easily be applied to the prior function we dicussed:

```{Rcpp independence_p2, cache=TRUE, eval = F}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
double average_parallel(NumericVector x,
                          unsigned int ncores = 2){
  unsigned int i, n;
  double sum = 0.0;
  n = x.size();
  
  #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum) num_threads(ncores) 
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += x[i]; 
  }
  return sum/n;
}
```


# $\pi$ Example: R to C++

**Objective:** Make a $\pi$ approximation function fast.

- Approximation function written in R.

```{r pi_problem_r}
pi_me_r = function(){ 
  
  num_steps = 100000
  x = sum_x = 0.0
  
  step = 1.0/num_steps
  
  for (i in 1:num_steps){
    x = (i + 0.5)*step
    sum_x = sum_x + 4.0/(1.0 + x*x)
  }
  
  return(step * sum_x) # Pi
}
```


# $\pi$ Example: R to C++


**Objective:** Make a $\pi$ approximation function fast.

- Same approximation function written in C++ using Rcpp.

```{Rcpp pi_problem, size='tiny'}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
double pi_me(){ 

  unsigned int num_steps = 100000;
  double x, pi, sum = 0.0;
  double step = 1.0/(double) num_steps;
  
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < num_steps; i++){
    x = (i + 0.5)*step;
    sum = sum + 4.0/(1.0 + x*x);
  }
  return step * sum;
}
```


# $\pi$ Example: C++ to Parallelized C++
- Note: The dependency on sum here.
- To parallelize it, we'll need to use a reduction and a private thread.

```{Rcpp adv_pi_problem, eval = F}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
double pi_me_parallel(unsigned int ncores = 2){
  unsigned int num_steps = 100000;
  unsigned int i; // declared earlier for parallel
  double x, sum = 0.0;
  double step = 1.0/(double) num_steps;
  
  #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum) num_threads(ncores) 
  for (i = 0; i < num_steps; i++){
    x = (i + 0.5)*step;
    sum = sum + 4.0/(1.0 + x*x);
  }
  return step * sum; // Pi
}
```

```{Rcpp adv_pi2, echo = F}
#include <Rcpp.h>
#include <omp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::plugins(openmp)]]
<<adv_pi_problem>>
```

# $\pi$ Benchmarks
The speed up of the approximation of $\pi$ is remarkable!

```{r benchmark_pi, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(rbenchmark)
knitr::kable(
  benchmark(cpp.parallel = pi_me_parallel(), cpp.serial = pi_me(), r = pi_me_r(),
            columns = c("test", "replications", "elapsed", "relative", "user.self", "sys.self"), 
            order = "relative")
)
```

# Extra Material: Implicit Parallelization

- Next up is Implicit parallelization. 
- Please note, that implicit parallelization does not mix well with explicit
parallelization due to core allocations needing to be specified in advance.


# Base Operations in R

Within R, there are two pieces of software that control how fast a matrix is manipulated and how quickly a numerical routine is run upon it. 

- **Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)** performs low-level linear algebra subroutine operations such as copying, scaling, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication.
- **Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK)** performs numerical routines such as solving linear equations, linear least-squares, and matrix factorizations (SVD, LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur).


# Single-Threaded Default BLAS Operations in R

- By default, R ships with a **single-threaded** BLAS and LAPACK. 
- This **restricts R** to operating matrix computations on a **single** core. 
- For perspective, the Department of Statistics' PCs have either **2 or 4 cores**.
- Thus, there are a considerable amount of computational cycles being wasted.

# Parallelizing Base Operations in R 

- To parallelize base operations in R, we need to get a new BLAS. 

- **The Good News...**
    - BLAS systems normally will ship with an optimized version of LAPACK.
- **The Bad News...**
    - You have to compile R
- **And The Ugly News...**
    - RevolutionAnalytics has its own [compiled version of R that uses MKL](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/download/), but their version of R lags behind developments in R.

# Parallelized BLAS Options

- Download and install a new multi-threaded BLAS
    - OpenBLAS: <http://www.openblas.net/>
    - MKL: <https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl>
    - ATLAS: <http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/>
- Install guides are only a google away for your specific system.

# macOS: Multithreaded vecLib BLAS via symbolic link
macOS users are able to easily switch to a multithreaded BLAS called vecLib by opening Terminal and typing the following: 

```{bash enable_multi_threaded_blas, eval=FALSE, size='scriptsize'}
cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib

# For R <= 2.15 version (old school R users)
# Line 2: 
ln -sf libRblas.vecLib.dylib libRblas.dylib

# For R >= 3.0 version (Latest Install)
# Line 2: 
ln -sf /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework
/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/Current/
libBLAS.dylib libRblas.dylib
```

The install differs between the two versions since as of 3.0, R has stopped shipping `vecLib` within the default install.


# Benchmarking BLAS change

```{r benchmark_code, eval=FALSE, size='small'}
# Create matrix
set.seed(1234)
a = crossprod(matrix(rnorm(3000^2),nrow=3000,ncol=3000)) 

#install.packages("rbenchmark")  # Install Package
library(rbenchmark)           # Load Benchmark Package
benchmark(chol(a))            # Benchmark 100 times
```

Results (Mid-2009 MBP, 2.53 GHz duo core CPU, 4 GB RAM):

| Test     | Replications | Elapsed | Relative | User Self | System Self |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `vecLib` | 100          | 136.512 |  1       | 249.465   | 5.402       |
| `default`| 100          | 564.854 | 4.138    | 562.928   | 1.759       |


# macOS: Revert to single-threaded BLAS

To *revert* to single-threaded BLAS (default) use:
