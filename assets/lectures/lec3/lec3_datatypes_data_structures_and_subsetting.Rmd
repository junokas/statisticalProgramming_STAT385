Overview
========================================================
Today's Goals are:

1. Last minute RStudio tweaks
2. Writing Good Code
3. Data Types in R
4. Data Structures (Vectors)
5. Subsetting

A note...
========================================================

I'm aware these slides at not nice to look at.
I'm working hard to create a `.Rmd` template that allows me to compile using my Illinois Template.

**Note:** These slides were switched from `.Rpres` to `.Rmd` due to technology difficulties.

Preparing your environment
========================================================

Navigate to Tools $\Rightarrow$ Global Options

```{r default_menu, out.width = "100px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/menu.png")
```

Preparing your environment
========================================================

- Uncheck `Restore .RData` into workspace at startup

- For `Save workspace to .RData on exit`, select the `Never` option from the dropdown. 

```{r default_rstudio, out.width = "200px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/default_rstudio.png")
```


Know thine RStudio Environment
========================================================

There are a *lot* of keyboard shortcuts in RStudio. These shortcuts are meant to speed up your work. 

To view all the options, you must engage the keyboard shortcut that rules them all:

- Windows: `Alt` + `Shift` + `K`
- macOS: `Option` + `Shift` + `K`

![RStudio Global Shortcut](figures/shortcut_info.png)

My Favorites
========================================================

1. Runs the current line and/or current selection from the editor to the console and runs it
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `Enter` 
    - macOS: `Cmd` + `Enter`
2. Comment multiple lines.
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`	
    - macOS: `Command` + `Shift` + `C`
3. Multicursor: 
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Up` (or `Down`)
    - macOS: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Up` (or `Down`)
4. Reindent Code:
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `L`
    - macOS: `Command` + `I`
4. Autocomplete command
    - Both: `Tab`

Writing Code
========================================================

> Good artists copy; great artists steal.
>
> --- Steve Jobs (quoted to Picaso but really T.S Elliot)

- To some degree, we will reinvent the wheel. 
- In other cases, you may not. 


Writing Code
========================================================

Somethings to know about:

- All R code is immediately accessible by just typing the function name.
```{r}
isTRUE
```

- Sometimes, we may need to pry into R using:
    - The [`pryr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pryr/index.html)'s `fun_body()`
    - R's `getAnywhere()` or `methods()`
- GitHub has a fantastic search engine for code chunks. 
    - Search via [org:cran](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran) using either the name of a function or idea.

Data Types
========================================================

To a computer, each *variable* must have a specific kind of *data type*. 

**Definition:**

*Data type* is a description that indicates the type of data that can object can hold.

```{r shape_game, out.width = "150px", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shape_game.jpg")
```

It is important that the data are matched with the approriate type.

Supported Data Types
========================================================

The different types of data supported by `R` are as follows:

- Numeric (double/float)
    - Examples: `-2`, `0.0`, `6.1`, `41.234`
- Integer
    - Examples: `-2L`,`0L`, `3L`, `10L`
- Complex
    - Examples: `-1 + 2i`, `0 + 0i`, `1 - 2i`
- Logical (boolean)
    - Examples: `TRUE` (`T`) and `FALSE` (`F`)
    - As a side note: `NA` (missing value) is also considered logical.
- Character
    - Examples: `"Hello"`, `"World"`, `"of Statistics"`, `"1 + 1"`
- Factor
    - Example: `Levels: 'May','Jun','Jul'`
- Ordered Factors:
    - Example: `Levels: 1 < 4 < 6`
    
Storing Information in a Variable
========================================================

- While using R, you may wish to call a calculation at a later time. In such cases, it is ideal to store the computation in a **variable**.

- You do *not* need to specify the variables data type in advance as R will handle that for you. This is good and bad for various reasons that will be covered next under **coercion**.

**Sample Assignments:**

```{r}
a = 1     # Assign 1 to `a`
b = 2     # Assign 2 to `b`

d = a + b # Assign the sum of `a` and `b` to `d`.
```

    
Storing Missingness in a Variable
========================================================

> An NA is the presence of an absence. Don't forget that some missing values are the absence of a presence
>
> --- Hadley Wickham [twitter](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/738802081448886272)

Within R, there is a specific type that handles "missingness". The type is `NA`. 

Storing Missingness in a Variable
========================================================

There are `NA` values for many data types. However, all you will really need is `NA`.

```{r}
NA            # Logical

NA_integer_   # Integer

NA_real_      # Double

NA_character_ # Character
```

Built-in constants
========================================================

R has a few pre-defined variables that will make life easier. 

As a result, you no longer have to google: [order of the alphabet](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=order+of+alphabet). 

```{r}
LETTERS     # Uppercase alphabet
letters     # Lowercase alphabet
```

Built-in constants
========================================================

```{r}
month.abb   # Abbreviated Month Name
month.name  # Full Month Name
pi          # Pi 
```

Be Warned of the Redefine
========================================================

You **can** overide these variables on a per session basis. 

So, be **careful** when using them. e.g.

```{r}
pi        # Initial Value
pi = 3.14 # Modified the equation
pi        # View new value
```

Keep this in mind during later when we work on debugging code... *wink*.


Preview Value during Assignment
========================================================

Previously, we opted to assign and then output the variable contents.

e.g.

```{r}
life = 42
life
```

By enclosing the assignment within paranthesis, e.g. `()`, we can omit one line:

```{r}
(life = 42)
```

Style Guide
========================================================

- When writing code, it is important, especisally in large organizations, to have a **consistent** style.
- Did you know, UIUC has its own [identity standards](http://identitystandards.illinois.edu/graphicstandardsmanual/index.html)? 
- For instance, to use UIUC's I-logo, university personnel and vendors must adhere to the correct usage case:

| Correct                       | Incorrect                        |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ![Default I](figures/i_mark_bold.png) | ![Orange in I](figures/orange_logo.gif)  |


Style Guide
========================================================

- In that vein, organizations, like Google, have created internal [style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for code.

- Now, style guides are not per say the *best* practices to use end of discussion. 
- Instead, they serve to unify the code written by a bunch of different individuals. 

Class Style Guide
========================================================

- For the most part, we will follow [Google's style advice](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), which is also used by [Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). 
- The main exception to this principle is the avoidance of using the `->` and `<-` assignment operators outside of piping (more later). Of course, you can also switch this by using [formatR](http://yihui.name/formatR/) by [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name) ([knitr author](http://yihui.name/knitr)).

```{r}
x = 1  # Good

x <- 1 # Bad
```

    
Heterogeneity and Homogenous Data Structures 
========================================================

R is **unique** in that it provides heterogeneous structures that enable data types to be mixed.

However, there are certain data types that must homogeneous or of the same type.

| Heterogeneous      | Homogeneous      |
|--------------------|------------------|
| ![jcf](figures/hetero.jpg) | ![h20](figures/homo.jpg) |

*Note:* Java Chip Frap: 4 Shots + 10 Frap Chips

Heterogeneity vs. Homogenous Data Structures
========================================================

The different data structures are as follows:

| Dimensions  | Homogeneous          | Heterogeneous |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 1d          | `atomic vector`      | `list`        |
| 2d          | `matrix`             | `data.frame`  |
| nd          | `array`              |               |

For the moment, we are going to focus on `vector` structures and `homogeneous` data.

**Questions:**

1. When might we need to use `n`-dimensions of data?
2. What happens if we mix one data type with another?
3. Which data structure could potentially rule them all? (e.g. be the parent)

Atomic Vectors
========================================================

The majority of work done in R uses **atomic vectors** as building blocks.

To create an empty atomic vector we can use:

```{r}
a = numeric()   # Numeric
b = integer()   # Integer
d = character() # String
e = complex()   # Complex Number
f = logical()   # Boolean
g = factor()    # Factor
```

This creates an atomic vector of length `0` of a specific type. 
```{r}
length(a) # Number of elements contained in the vector
```

Atomic Vectors
========================================================

**Notes:**

1. We can only store **one** specific data type per atomic vector (hence, homogeneous).
2. The length of `0` is only problematic in the case of a `factor`.

Vectors Initialization
========================================================

To create a vector of length `n`, simply:

```{r}
n = 20L         # Store a number
a = numeric(n)  # Create a double
a               # View entries
length(a)       # Verify the length
```

Vectors Initialization
========================================================

Alternatively, if the values for the vector are already known, the vector can be created using:

```{r}
(a2 = c(-1,2,4,5,1,6,41,31,23))
(b2 = c(1L,2L,3L))
```

Notes:

- `c()` can also be used to concatenate different (add together) objects
- Avoid naming functions or variables with `c`!

Atomic Vector Depth
========================================================

Atomic vectors must always be *flat*. 

That is, if you nest different atomic vectors with concatenation, `c()`, the resulting atomic vector should always have dimension 1:

```{r}
c(1, c(2, c(3, 4)))  # Nested concatenation

c(1, 2, 3, 4)        # Traditional construction
```


Atomic Vector Properties
========================================================

Each atomic vector has its own properties, in the case of `a`, we have:

```{r}
typeof(a)        # Determine the type of `a`
typeof(b2)       # Determine the type of `b2`
```

Atomic Vector Properties
========================================================

Attributes, which will cover in depth later, can be viewed as a way to add additional data or metadata.
```{r}
attributes(a)     # Access metadata of `a`
```

Note: The initial vector does not have any other attributes associated with it. We can add some using:

```{r}
# Set metadata of `a` to include parameter sample with value statistics
attr(a,"sample") = "Statistics" 
attributes(a)      # Access metadata of `a`
```

Identifying an Atomic Vector
========================================================

To identify the type of an atomic vector, you can create your own check statement or use a built-in function:

```{r eval = F}
is.character(letters) # Checks for characters
is.double(1.2:4.4)    # Check for doubles
is.integer(1L:4L)     # Checks for integers
is.logical(c(T,F))    # Checks for booleans
is.atomic(1:4)        # Checks for atomic vector
```

**Note:** Do not use: `is.vector()`! You will be disappointed in the results.

Mixing Homogeneous Types
========================================================

As hinted to earlier, it is not ideal to mix homogenous types. 

Consider two atomic vectors: 

```{r}
a = runif(5)      # Five random numbers from within [0,1]
b = letters[1:5]  # First 5 letters of the alphabet
```

The structure of these vectors are:

```{r}
str(a)            # View the structure of `a`

str(b)            # View the structure of `b`
```


Mixing Homogeneous Types
========================================================

If we merge them, we get:

```{r}
d = c(a, b)       # Concatenate `a` and `b`

str(d)            # View the structure of `d`
```

Notes:
- Merging with `characters` yields `numeric`

Converting Between Homogeneous Types
========================================================

Sometimes, you may have data that has been given to you in `character` form but really should be `numeric` and vice versa.

To move between formats you can use:

```{r}
(x = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
as.numeric(x)

```

Atomic Vector Access
========================================================

We can access each element using the `[` operator. 

```{r}
a[1]     # Access and print first element

a[1] = 2 # Accesss and assign new value to first element

a[1]     # Access and print first element
```

**Note:** All vectors in *R* start with index 1. 


Naming Atomic Vector Values
========================================================

Sometimes, it might be helpful to label what each value in an Atomic vector is apart of:

e.g. 

```{r}
x = c("sphynx" = -1, "calypso" = 2, "doomsday" = 0, 
      "life" = 42, "nine" = 9)
```

As a result, each component can be referred to by a name:

```{r}
x[c("doomsday", "life")]
```

Naming Atomic Vector Values
========================================================

All of the names within the vector can be known with:
```{r}
names(x)
```


Subsetting with Vectors
========================================================

Sometimes, we may wish to only look at a specific piece of data.

We can get elements at specific positions with:
```{r}
x[c(2, 4)]
```

Or, we can remove elements at specific positions with:
```{r}
x[-c(2, 4)]
```

Subsetting with Vectors
========================================================

Notes:

1. Indexes must be all positive or all negative.
2. You cannot use names to remove an element.

```{r, eval = F}
x[-c("doomsday", "life")]
# Error in -c("doomsday", "life") : 
# invalid argument to unary operator
```

Edge Subsetting Cases
========================================================

If an index is not included, then the entire vector will be displayed

```{r}
x[]   # All terms
```

If you specify 0, there will be an empty vector:
```{r}
x[0]  # Empty Vector
```

Edge Subsetting Cases
========================================================

If the element is out of bounds, then you will receive an `NA` vector
```{r}
x[9]  # Only one NA returned

x[NA] # All terms are NA
```


Changing Element order withing Atomic Vectors
========================================================

More often then not, you will want to know the progression of elements either in an increasing or decreasing form.

To do so, use: 

```{r}
x[order(x)]                   # Ascending Order

x[order(x, decreasing = T)]   # Descending Order
```


Changing Element order withing Atomic Vectors
========================================================

Alternatively, you can sort the vector
```{r}
sort(x)
```

Shortcuts
========================================================

Vectors have many convenient short cuts. 

1. `x:y` operator allows for the generation of an integer vector. 
    - `r x = 1:5` `x = 1:5` generates a vector of length `5` that contains $1,2,3, \ldots, 5$ and assigns it to `x`.
2. `*x`,`/x`,`+x` operators allow the vector to be modified by a term. 

Shortcuts
========================================================

```{r}
2 * x       # Multiply all values by two

x / 3       # Divide all values by three

x + 1       # Add one to all values.

2 * (x - 1) # Subtract one from all values and then multiply by 2
```

Summing an atomic vector
========================================================

There are two ways we can go about adding up the contents within an atomic vector.

We can use a loop:
```{r}
x = 1:5                  # Create initial vector
sumx = 0                 # Create a sum value

for(i in seq_along(x)){  # Create an index vector
   sumx = sumx + x[i]    # Access each [i] and sum over it
}
```


Summing an atomic vector
========================================================

Or, we can use a vectorized function:
```{r}
sumx_v2 = sum(x)         # Use a vectorized calculation
```

We will need to verify if the calculation is the same:
```{r}
all.equal(sumx, sumx_v2) # Verify equality
```


Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================

- `rep()` function provides a way to replicate values throughout the vector.
```{r}
# Generates a vector of length `5` that contains only 1
rep(1,5)
```

Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================

- `seq()` function provides a way to create a sequence of values.
    - **Note:** This approach is considerably slower than using `1:5` due to the methods genericness.
```{r}
# Generates a vector of length `5` that contains 1, 2, 3, ... , 5
seq(1,5)
```

Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================

- `seq(from,to,by)` function provides a way to create a sequence of values with a specific incrementer.
```{r}
# Generates a vector of length `10` containing 0.0, 0.1, ..., 1.0
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
```


Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================

For the next set of shortcuts, note the following assignments:

```{r}
y = c(1,5,6,2,4) # Create a vector
n = length(y)    # Obtain the Length
```



Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================
- `seq_len()` function provides a way to create a vector based on length.
```{r}
# Generates a vector starting at `1` and going to `n`.
seq_len(n)
```

**Note:** We will see an example later where this is used to protect a looping counter.

Other helpful shortcuts
========================================================

- `seq_along()` function provides a way to obtain an index for each element in the vector.
```{r}
# Generates a vector starting at `1` and 
# going to `length(y)`. 
seq_along(y)
```

**Note:** We will see an example later where this is used to protect a looping counter.

A note on shortcuts
========================================================

*Warning:* If the term being multiplied is another vector, R will recycle values in the previous vector. 

Take for example:
`r x = 1:6`
```{r}
x         # Original
c(-1,1)*x # Recycled values of x
```


A note on shortcuts
========================================================

This is helpful when constructing confidence intervals. Consider the Confidence Intervals for Proportions Formula:

\begin{align}
Estimate &\pm MOE \\
\hat p &\pm {z_{\alpha /2} }\left( {\sqrt {\frac{ {\hat p\left( {1 - \hat p} \right)} }{n} } } \right)
\end{align}

How could we use this property to avoid recomputing the MOE?
