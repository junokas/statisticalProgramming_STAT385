# Overview

In the Data Science realm of *R*, the biggest breakthrough occurred back in 2014 with
the introduction of a **pipe operator** to the *R* ecosystem. The creation
of the pipe has lead to several *tidy* concepts. As a practical exercise, the
pipe concept will be applied during web scrapping.
