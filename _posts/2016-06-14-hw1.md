# Directions

While working on homework, students are encouraged to work together in a group. Though, each student must turn in their own homework answers.  If students opt to work together, then it is important that they list the names of the students that they have collaborated with. Please note that sharing, copying or providing any part of a homework solution or code to another student is an infraction of the Universityâ€™s rules on Academic Integrity. Rest assured, any violation of Academic Integrity will be punished **as severely as possible**.

* Your assignment must be submitted through the e-mail to `balamut2` [at] illinois [dot] edu. You are required to attach three (and only three) files to the *same* e-mail:
    * The RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file must be saved as `hw1_yourNetID.Rmd`, e.g.  `hw1_balamut2.Rmd`
    * The generated output from the `.Rmd` file is then contained in `hw1_yourNetID.html`, e.g. `hw1_balamut2.Rmd`.
    * Any code should be placed in an external file given as `r_hw1_yourNetID.R`, e.g. `r_hw1_balamut2.R`.
* Under this structure, the content found within the `.html` file will be considered a "report" which is the material that will determine the majority of your grade. Be sure to visibly include all `R` code and output that is relevant to answering the exercises. (You do not need to include irrelevant code you tried that resulted in error or did not answer the question correctly.)
* There are no limitations as to the number of submissions that can be made. However,  only the last submission *before* the deadline will be graded by myself or the grader.

Note: This homework has had its deadline **extended** until Tuesday, June 21st by 11:59 PM CDT!

**Extended Deadline:** Tuesday, June 21st by 11:59 PM CDT

2. Create a GitHub account
3. Initialize a Repository
4. Make an RStudio project linked to version control. 
5. Commit and Push a change. 
6. Vector Operations
7. `Rmd` Files

## Exercise 0 (Where am I?)

For this exercise, we will test to see if you have visited the [syllabus page](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/syllabus/).

1. When does the class meet?
2. Is it appropriate to e-mail the instructor with: "Group project question"? If not, provide a correction.
3. How many exams are there?
4. Where is the instructors office? 
5. What is the instructor's office hours?
6. Who is the instructor?
7. How much is each component of the group project?


## Exercise 1 (Know Thine Environment)

For this exercise, you will use either your local install of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) + [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/download) or the [Online Analytical Environment](https://rstudio.stat.illinois.edu/rstudio).

To verify the success of this exercise (and your choice) please take a screenshot of each application and included it.

To take a screenshot press:

1. Windows: [`Windows Key` + `PrtScn`](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/take-screen-capture-print-screen#take-screen-capture-print-screen=windows-8) or use the [Snipping tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-capture-screen-shots#1TC=windows-8)
2. macOS: [`Command` + `Shift` + `3`](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) or use [`Command` + `Shift` + `4`](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) for part of your screen.

### Local:

If you are running on **Windows**, please install all software under Admin. e.g. Right click on the installer and select `Run as administrator` from the context menu.

![Run as Admin](/assets/hw/hw1/run_as_admin.png)

Install the following software:

1. [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
2. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/download)
3. `git` 
    * [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    * **macOS**
        * Open `Terminal` in `/Applications/Utilities/`
        * Type `xcode-select --install`
        * Press `Install`, wait for a 150 Mb download, and then watch it install. 
        * Once it is done installing, write `git --version`.
4. [GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Remote:

1. Log into [Online Analytical Environment](https://rstudio.stat.illinois.edu/rstudio).
2. Rejoice! (Or e-mail me if you lack authorization)

### All: 

With `git` installed, we need to provide a bit of information for the `git` client. 

Within RStudio, go to `Tools` > `Shell`

![Access Shell in RStudio](/assets/hw/hw1/rstudio_shell.png)

Type the following two commands:


```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name Here'
git config --global user.email 'E-Mail Used on GitHub'
```

In my case, it would be:


```bash
git config --global user.name 'James Balamuta'
git config --global user.email 'balamut2@illinois.edu'
```


Now, within the console section of RStudio, write:


```r
yn = readline(prompt="Hello, what is your name? ")
```

And respond to it!

Then type:


```r
cat("Hello ", yn,"! I am R.", sep = "")
```

(Screenshot required)


## Exercise 2 (To GitHub and Beyond)

For this exercise, we will create an account on GitHub and our first repository!

1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) with your `@illinois.edu` e-mail address.
    * If you can, try to name your account: `firstnamelastname` or `firstname-lastname`.
1. Fill in your [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) with a picture and short bio.
1. Request an [educational discount](https://education.github.com/) to obtain private repositories.
1. Initialize a new repository on GitHub called `stat385hw1`. 

Please include in your `Rmd` file links to:

1. Your GitHub Profile
1. Your first repository

## Exercise 3 (["Start of Something Good"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKsyxZWQ_g0))

The goal behind this exercise is to get you familiar with using RStudio's `git` GUI, project workflow, and `Rmd` files. 

1. Create an RStudio Project with Version Control
2. Create a new file within this project containing your previous work in the `Rmd` file. (Or just copy the file to the directory.)
3. Commit the `Rmd` file with a unique commit message.
4. Push the commit to GitHub.

## Exercise 4 (Gotta Catch'em All!)

Within this excerise, we will play with `numeric`, `character`, and `logical` vectors in R. 

1. Construct the following five numeric vectors `a`, `b`, `d`, `e`, and `y` each with a length of `25` under the following conditions:
    - `a`: All values are `0`.
    - `b`: The first 25 square numbers, starting from `1.` (So `1`, `4`, `9`, etc.)
    - `d`: 25 evenly spaced numbers starting from `0` and going to `1`. 
         * Note: It may help to read the documentation for `seq()` via `?seq`.
    - `e`: The *natural* log, e.g. $\ln ()$, of the integers from `1` to `25`.
         * **Note:** You may want to read the help documentation for `log()` via `?log` 
    - `y`: The result of running the following code, after creating the other four vectors:


```r
set.seed(1337)                  # Replace with your favorite number
y  = 2 * a + b / 4 + 8 * d - 3 * e + rnorm(25, 0 , 1)
```
2. Modify the vector `a` so that all of its entries are `42`.
    - Rerun **without the seed** the `y` computation step.
    - Rerun **with** the seed the `y` computation step.
    - What is the difference between the two? (Outside the set seed)
3. Construct the following two `character` vectors `f` and `g` under the following conditions:
    - `f`: Contains the entire alphabet in lowercase.
    - `g`: The concatenation of vectors `f` and `b` (from 1.)
    - Comment on how the entries of `b` have changed.
4. Create a `logical` vector based on whether the results of `y` are greater than `10`.
    - Using the `logical` vector, create a sum indicating how many elements are greater than `10`.
    - *Psst:* This is what is called an [indicator or dummy variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)) and it is used in regression as well as [indexing problems](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Basics/Indexing_into_a_data_structure/#indexing-with-a-boolean-vector).

## Exercise 5 (Alternating Current)

Within this exercise, you will explore vector recycling and vectorized computation. 

Calculate each element given by the following:

1. ${\left( { - 1} \right)^{2*n + 1} }$ from $n = 1$ to $n = 100$
1. ${\left( { - 1} \right)^{2*n} }$ from $n = 1$ to $n = 100$

1. What is the pattern associated with these values?
    - Please use either inline `$ math $` or display `$$ math block $$` to write your response. For math specific symbols, see [LaTeX/Mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics). Generally, `$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $` gives $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, which is inline, and `$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$` gives $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$, which is a display block.

Compute the summation of:

1. $$ \sum\limits_{n = 2}^{100} {\frac{ {\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} }{ {\sqrt n } } }$$
1. $$ \sum\limits_{n = 2}^{100} {\frac{ { { {\left( { - 1} \right)}^{n + 1} } } }{n} } $$
1. $$ \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{100} {\frac{ { { {\left( { - 1} \right)}^{2n} }n} }{ { {n^2} + 5} } } $$
