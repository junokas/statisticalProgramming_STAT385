# Overview

Data often has many patterns to reveal to us. However, we do need to poke at it
to understand its subtleties. Thus, we need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) on the data. In particular, the most basic aspects of EDA are to obtain
quantitative information that provides an overall summary of the data.
